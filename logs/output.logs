2024-04-26 15:51:24 Block2_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	Zooglea, also known as biofilm, is a complex matrix of microorganisms such as bacteria, algae, fungi and other organic materials. It often forms in damp and nutrient-rich environments, creating a slimy layer that adheres to various surfaces. In the context of HVAC systems, zooglea can thrive in the dark and moist corners of ducts, coils, drains and condensate pans.

2024-04-26 15:51:25 Heading 2: < Formation of Zooglea > MATCHED

2024-04-26 15:51:25 Block3_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	The formation of zooglea begins with microscopic organisms finding a suitable surface to attach to. In HVAC systems, this could be the inner surfaces of ductwork, coils or any component with persistent moisture. As these microorganisms multiply, they secrete a slimy substance that provides a protective environment, allowing the formation of a biofilm.

2024-04-26 15:51:25 Block3_Paragraph 2 MATCHED

	The increase in HVAC systems that use all aluminum coils seems to have accelerated the growth of zooglea. That's because these systems no longer have copper in their coils, which is a metal that can act as an antibacterial that helps bust the biofilms.

2024-04-26 15:51:25 Heading 3: < Zooglea and HVAC Systems: Sworn Enemies > MATCHED

2024-04-26 15:51:25 Block4_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	The presence of zooglea in HVAC systems poses several challenges. One of the most immediate concerns is compromised air quality. The microbial activity within the biofilm can release allergens and other pollutants into the air that circulates throughout your living spaces. Zooglea can obstruct airflow and reduce the efficiency of your HVAC system, leading to higher energy use and elevated utility bills. It can also completely block drain lines, causing a backup of condensation that can cause your system to shut down.

2024-04-26 16:00:53 Block2_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	Zooglea, also known as biofilm, is a complex matrix of microorganisms such as bacteria, algae, fungi and other organic materials. It often forms in damp and nutrient-rich environments, creating a slimy layer that adheres to various surfaces. In the context of HVAC systems, zooglea can thrive in the dark and moist corners of ducts, coils, drains and condensate pans.

2024-04-26 16:00:53 Heading 2: < Formation of Zooglea > MATCHED

2024-04-26 16:00:53 Block3_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	The formation of zooglea begins with microscopic organisms finding a suitable surface to attach to. In HVAC systems, this could be the inner surfaces of ductwork, coils or any component with persistent moisture. As these microorganisms multiply, they secrete a slimy substance that provides a protective environment, allowing the formation of a biofilm.

2024-04-26 16:00:53 Block3_Paragraph 2 MATCHED

	The increase in HVAC systems that use all aluminum coils seems to have accelerated the growth of zooglea. That's because these systems no longer have copper in their coils, which is a metal that can act as an antibacterial that helps bust the biofilms.

2024-04-26 16:00:53 Heading 3: < Zooglea and HVAC Systems: Sworn Enemies > MATCHED

2024-04-26 16:00:53 Block4_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	The presence of zooglea in HVAC systems poses several challenges. One of the most immediate concerns is compromised air quality. The microbial activity within the biofilm can release allergens and other pollutants into the air that circulates throughout your living spaces. Zooglea can obstruct airflow and reduce the efficiency of your HVAC system, leading to higher energy use and elevated utility bills. It can also completely block drain lines, causing a backup of condensation that can cause your system to shut down.

2024-04-26 16:00:53 Block4_Paragraph 2 MATCHED

	Additionally, the biofilm can contribute to foul odors emanating from the vents. The microbial

2024-04-26 16:00:53 Block4_Paragraph 3 MATCHED

	activity produces volatile organic compounds that, when released into the air, create an unpleasant and potentially harmful indoor environment.

2024-04-26 16:00:53 Heading 4: < You’ll Know It When You See It > MATCHED

2024-04-26 16:00:53 Block5_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	The most common place you'll find zooglea is in the drain pans or the drain lines that carry moisture away from your HVAC system. While it's common for these areas to see a buildup of other biofilms, such as fungus and algae, what distinguishes zooglea is that it is a whitish gelatinous paste, which has earned it the unfortunate name of drain snot.

2024-04-26 16:00:53 Block5_Paragraph 2 MATCHED

	When deciding if you have a zooglea issue or not, be sure not to confuse the biofilm with the oil that sometimes coats the coils and drains in the system. This can also present as a white gluey substance. In general, if your system is new and you see such a substance, it's likely the oil, and you can get rid of it with a thorough cleaning by your HVAC professional. If the system is older, then it's likely zooglea.

2024-04-29 20:15:00 Block2_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	A water heater filter is a device designed to remove sediment, minerals and other impurities from the water supply before they enters your water heater. It’s primarily thanks to the filter that you can enjoy fresh water for showers and washing dishes. These filters help prevent scale buildup, improve water quality and prolong the life span of your heater. They typically come in the form of cartridges or filter systems installed on your heater’s incoming water line.

2024-04-29 20:15:00 Block3_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	Water heater filters typically need to be replaced every six to 12 months to maintain optimal performance. However, this timeframe can vary depending on factors such as water quality, usage and the type of filter installed. Regular replacement helps ensure efficient filtration, preventing sediment buildup and maintaining your water’s quality. Some high-capacity filters may last longer before needing replacement, but you should still monitor their condition regularly as there’s no guarantee of longevity. Keeping up with scheduled replacements ensures your water heater continues to deliver clean, high-quality hot water while prolonging its life span.

2024-04-29 20:15:01 Block5_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	Yes, there are several types of water heater filters available, each with its own set of features and benefits. Let’s look at the most common types, what makes them unique and their price ranges:

2024-04-29 20:15:01 Block5_Sub Heading 2 MATCHED

	Sediment Filters

2024-04-29 20:15:01 Block5_Paragraph 3 MATCHED

	Sediment filters address a broad spectrum of impurities found in water, including sand, dirt and rust, effectively safeguarding your water heater from these damaging particles. With prices typically ranging from $15 to $65 (CAD 21 to CAD 88) for one to three units, sediment filters offer an affordable yet effective solution for improving water quality and protecting your water heating system.

2024-04-29 20:15:01 Block5_Sub Heading 4 MATCHED

	Carbon Filters

2024-04-29 20:15:02 Block5_Paragraph 5 MATCHED

	Carbon filters have an exceptional ability to target specific contaminants, particularly chlorine, odors and organic compounds. Unlike sediment filters, which trap particles, carbon filters chemically absorb and neutralize impurities in the water. This unique filtration process not only enhances water clarity but also improves its taste and odor, resulting in a more enjoyable hot water experience. As with sediment filters, prices for one to three units typically range between $15 and $65 (CAD 21 and CAD 88).

2024-04-29 20:15:02 Block5_Sub Heading 6 MATCHED

	Scale Inhibitors

2024-04-29 20:15:02 Block5_Paragraph 7 MATCHED

	Scale inhibitors, also known as phosphate filters, focus on preventing the accumulation of scale within the system. They target the mineral deposits responsible for scale buildup. The inhibitors utilize advanced technologies, such as polyphosphate treatment or reverse osmosis, to alter the chemistry of the water. This process effectively inhibits the formation of scale on heating elements and internal surfaces. Prices for scale inhibitors can vary considerably, but you should expect to pay in the region of $117 (CAD 159) for a system and around $73 (CAD 99) every time you need to replace the cartridge. Although costly, scale inhibitors can be invaluable over time, as they can prolong your water heater’s life span and its optimal performance.

2024-04-29 20:23:10 Block2_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	Zooglea, also known as biofilm, is a complex matrix of microorganisms such as bacteria, algae, fungi and other organic materials. It often forms in damp and nutrient-rich environments, creating a slimy layer that adheres to various surfaces. In the context of HVAC systems, zooglea can thrive in the dark and moist corners of ducts, coils, drains and condensate pans.

2024-04-29 20:23:10 Heading 2: < Formation of Zooglea > MATCHED

2024-04-29 20:23:10 Block3_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	The formation of zooglea begins with microscopic organisms finding a suitable surface to attach to. In HVAC systems, this could be the inner surfaces of ductwork, coils or any component with persistent moisture. As these microorganisms multiply, they secrete a slimy substance that provides a protective environment, allowing the formation of a biofilm.

2024-04-29 20:23:10 Block3_Paragraph 2 MATCHED

	The increase in HVAC systems that use all aluminum coils seems to have accelerated the growth of zooglea. That's because these systems no longer have copper in their coils, which is a metal that can act as an antibacterial that helps bust the biofilms.

2024-04-29 20:23:11 Block4_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	The presence of zooglea in HVAC systems poses several challenges. One of the most immediate concerns is compromised air quality. The microbial activity within the biofilm can release allergens and other pollutants into the air that circulates throughout your living spaces. Zooglea can obstruct airflow and reduce the efficiency of your HVAC system, leading to higher energy use and elevated utility bills. It can also completely block drain lines, causing a backup of condensation that can cause your system to shut down.

2024-04-29 20:23:11 Block4_Paragraph 2 MATCHED

	Additionally, the biofilm can contribute to foul odors emanating from the vents. The microbial

2024-04-29 20:23:11 Block5_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	The most common place you'll find zooglea is in the drain pans or the drain lines that carry moisture away from your HVAC system. While it's common for these areas to see a buildup of other biofilms, such as fungus and algae, what distinguishes zooglea is that it is a whitish gelatinous paste, which has earned it the unfortunate name of drain snot.

2024-04-29 20:23:11 Block5_Paragraph 2 MATCHED

	When deciding if you have a zooglea issue or not, be sure not to confuse the biofilm with the oil that sometimes coats the coils and drains in the system. This can also present as a white gluey substance. In general, if your system is new and you see such a substance, it's likely the oil, and you can get rid of it with a thorough cleaning by your HVAC professional. If the system is older, then it's likely zooglea.

	Understanding AFUE ratings can empower you to make informed choices about your heating system. Consequently, you can keep your home warm while also managing your financial and environmental well-being.

2024-04-29 20:24:00 Heading 1: < What Is an AFUE Rating? > MATCHED

2024-04-29 20:24:00 Block2_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	AFUE is a rating system that measures the efficiency of gas-fired and electric heating systems, such as furnaces and boilers. Imagine your furnace as a machine converting fuel, such as oil or propane, into heat. The AFUE rating reflects how effectively this conversion happens over a year.

2024-04-29 20:24:00 Heading 2: < How Is AFUE Measured? > MATCHED

2024-04-29 20:24:00 Block3_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	AFUE is measured by dividing the system's heat output by the total fuel energy consumed. Essentially, it measures how much of the fuel's energy translates into usable heat for your home. While a higher AFUE indicates better efficiency, factors such as maintenance, insulation and ductwork also influence overall performance. So, if you’re considering heating options, understanding AFUE can help gauge your long-term energy costs and environmental impact.

	Before we answer that question, let’s take a look at the different AFUE ranges to understand the differences between low- and high-efficiency boilers and furnaces.

2024-04-29 20:24:00 Block4_List 2 NOT MATCHED

	Low-efficiency: These appliances, while meeting minimum standards, are considered outdated and wasteful. They convert less than 70% of fuel into heat, leading to higher energy bills and carbon emissions. If your furnace or boiler is in this range, you should seriously consider replacing it.
Mid-efficiency: This category represents a significant improvement, with appliances utilizing 80%-83% of fuel for heating. This translates to cost savings and reduced environmental impact compared to low-efficiency models. Long term, much of the cost of installing a boiler or furnace with this rating can be offset by lower energy bills.
High-efficiency: Appliances with these ratings are considered the champions of efficiency. They convert 90% or more of fuel into heat, resulting in substantial savings on your energy bills and minimizing your carbon footprint. They often come equipped with advanced technologies, such as condensing heat exchangers, that further maximize their efficiency.

	$2,000 and $5,200|https://homeguide.com/costs/gas-furnace-prices

2024-04-29 20:24:01 Block4_List 4 MATCHED

	Your climate. If you live in a region with harsh winters and prolonged heating needs, a high-efficiency furnace (90%+) could significantly reduce your energy bills over time. However, in milder climates, a mid-efficiency model (80%-90%) might offer an adequate balance between cost and efficiency. You should expect to pay between $2,000 and $5,200 (CAD 2,694 and CAD 7,004) for a mid-efficiency model.
Your budget. High-efficiency furnaces generally have a higher up-front cost. For example, a gas furnace installation will cost between $3,300 and $6,900 (CAD 4,445 and CAD 9,294). While they deliver long-term savings, the initial investment might not be feasible for everyone. Consider the payback period — how long it takes for the energy savings to offset the higher initial cost.
Environmental impact. If minimizing your carbon footprint is a priority, a high-efficiency furnace is the clear winner. Its lower fuel consumption translates to reduced greenhouse gas emissions.

2024-04-29 20:24:54 Block2_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	Balancing your radiator means ensuring each radiator in your home receives the right amount of hot water, according to its size and location. If they’re not balanced, some radiators may get too much hot water, while others may get too little. This causes uneven heating, cold spots and wasted energy. Balancing solves these problems by regulating the flow of hot water to each radiator using valves located on the pipework. Let’s look at the two types of valves you need to know about.

2024-04-29 20:24:54 Block2_Sub Heading 2 MATCHED

	Thermostatic Radiator Valves (TRVs)

2024-04-29 20:24:54 Block2_Paragraph 3 MATCHED

	TRVs are usually located on the side or the bottom of the radiator and have a numbered dial or a knob you can turn to adjust the heat level. They automatically adjust the flow of hot water to each radiator, depending on the room temperature and your preference. However, TRVs can sometimes malfunction or become inaccurate and may not work well with other valves in the system. Therefore, you may still need to balance your radiator manually using the other type of valve.

2024-04-29 20:24:54 Block2_Sub Heading 4 MATCHED

	Lockshield Valves

2024-04-29 20:24:54 Block2_Paragraph 5 MATCHED

	These are usually located on the opposite end of the radiator from the TRV and have a plastic cap that covers a small valve. They’re meant to be adjusted only when you need to balance your radiator. Lockshield valves can control the flow of hot water to each radiator by opening or closing the valve, using a radiator bleeding key or using an adjustable spanner.

	The average cost of a new radiator can vary depending on several factors, such as the type of radiator you need for the room in your home. According to HomeGuide, you should expect to pay between $700 and $1,300 (CAD 947 and CAD 1,759) per radiator if you’re replacing them in your home.

2024-04-29 20:25:39 Block3_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	There's a wide array of radiator options available. Here's a brief breakdown of the most common types (not including installation costs).

2024-04-29 20:25:39 Block3_List 2 MATCHED

	Single panel: Because this type uses the least amount of material, it’s usually the most affordable option. Expect to pay between $100 and $300 (CAD 136 and CAD 406) if it’s the plumbed type and $100 to $450 (CAD 136 to CAD 609) for the electric version.
Double panel: This version typically uses twice as much material as a single panel radiator, so you should expect to pay more. Costs will likely be between $300 and $500 (CAD 406 and CAD 677) for plumbed versions and $300 to $1,500 (CAD 406 to CAD 2,030) for electrical ones.
Column: Column radiators are normally made from cast iron, steel or aluminum, giving them a classically elegant appearance. Costs reflect this, at between $500 and $1,200 (CAD 677 and CAD 1,624) for plumbed options and $300 and $1,400 (CAD 406 and CAD 1,894) for the electrical equivalent.
Flat panel: Plumbed versions of these slim, wall-mounted radiators typically cost between $200 and $1,200 (CAD 271 and CAD 1,624), while the electric type is between $300 and $900 (CAD 406 and CAD 1,218). However, you're likely to recoup some of your initial outlay through lower energy bills, as they're particularly energy-efficient.
Baseboard: The cost differences between plumbed and electric models aren’t as wide for this type of radiator. Both versions start at around $100 (CAD 136), but the plumbed version can be as much as $1,500 (CAD 2,030). The electric version could run up to $1,200 (CAD 1,624).

	Dealing with a malfunctioning radiator is no fun at all, especially in the middle of a cold snap. Whether your radiator still has a bit of life left or it's completely shot, you may be wondering if you can just skip the middleman and install a new radiator yourself. Electric wall radiators are pretty easy to install in a DIY fashion, but wall radiators that run on steam are a bit more complex and may require professional assistance. Understanding the radiator installation process can help you make an informed decision on the future of your new heating system.

	Installing an electric radiator heat system is fairly simple. In most cases, all you'll need to do is unplug your existing unit and plug in your new radiator. However, depending on the size of your radiator, you may need some assistance with removal and installation. Specific weights can vary depending on the make, model and brand, but most electric radiators weigh between 37 and 124 pounds (17 and 55 kilograms).

	Turn off your home's water supply and switch off the steam boiler.
Use a wrench to loosen the nuts that mount the radiator to the wall.
Open the bleed valve and drain out any remaining water from the old radiator.
Remove the old radiator and replace the hand valve and spud.
Use a wrench to connect the hand valve to the floor and spud, making sure the hand valve is completely parallel with the floor.
Install the new radiator in place of the old unit, and use the wrench to connect it to the boiler pipe.
Open the hand valve and turn on the water supply and steam boiler.

	While an electric radiator has a pretty straightforward installation, steam boiler radiators are a bit trickier. If you can handle the heavy lifting and you're comfortable with the detailed installation process for the steam-heated radiator, DIY installation is possible. However, if you run into any issues or have concerns about installing the unit safely, it's best to contact a licensed plumber for assistance.

	Enter the salt-free water softener: a limescale-busting solution that won't raise your salt consumption. These units work differently from salt-based models and can help prevent clogged pipes, but they're also relatively pricey. Below, we'll explain how much a saltless water softener costs.

2024-04-29 20:27:10 Block2_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	Saltless water softeners are an alternative to regular salt water softeners to treat hard water. Unlike softeners with salt, they don't remove hard minerals from your water supply. Instead, they crystallize the minerals by changing their chemical state to minimize their effects.

2024-04-29 20:27:10 Block2_Paragraph 2 MATCHED

	Whole-house saltless water softeners attach to your plumbing system near the main water inlet, allowing water to flow through the unit for treatment before supplying your fixtures. You can also purchase smaller point-of-use units to soften the water supplying a single fixture, such as a shower or faucet.

2024-04-29 20:27:10 Block2_Paragraph 3 MATCHED

	Salt-free water softeners have a tank containing polymer beads called template-assisted crystallization media. The beads feature small depressions or craters that attract magnesium and calcium ions to create crystals. These crystals drop off when they reach the correct size and remain in your water supply.

2024-04-29 20:27:10 Block2_Paragraph 4 MATCHED

	Treating your water with a salt-free water softener can reduce limescale buildup in your pipes. It can also be a good option if you require a low-sodium diet. However, it's less effective at reducing issues such as soap scum buildup and skin dryness than salt-based models.

	Small, single-fixture models are cheaper to install, with most plumbers charging between $100 and $300 (CAD 136 and CAD 407) per unit. Meanwhile, the labor to install a whole-house saltless water softening system starts at around $300 (CAD 407) and could exceed $1,000 (CAD 1,357) for complex installations. You may pay more if you live in an expensive city or your plumber struggles to access your water main.

2024-04-29 20:28:00 Block2_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	Mold thrives in moist, dark places with minimal air circulation, making your fridge an ideal breeding ground. Moldy food is one of the most common causes of moldy odors. When you leave uncovered or improperly sealed food in the fridge for extended periods of time, mold can develop and lead to strong moldy or musty smells. Spilled foods and beverages can also cause moisture to pool on your refrigerator surfaces. Over time, these minor spills can evolve into messy mold.

2024-04-29 20:28:00 Block2_Paragraph 2 MATCHED

	The rubber seal on your refrigerator door is another common culprit of mold growth. If the seal pulls away slightly from the door surface, it can create a small crevice that's perfect for trapping moisture. When you open the refrigerator door, the cold air from inside the fridge meets the warmer air in your kitchen and creates condensation. If the condensation finds its way behind the loose seal, mold growth can occur.

	Moldy odors in your fridge without the presence of visible mold may be due to a moldy drip pan or moisture buildup in your refrigerator's internal drainage system. Drip pans sit beneath the fridge, and they should be cleaned every few months to prevent mold and mildew growth. If the issue is internal, it's always best to call in an experienced appliance repair professional to inspect your refrigerator and safely perform the necessary repairs.

2024-04-30 17:10:39 Block2_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	Zooglea, also known as biofilm, is a complex matrix of microorganisms such as bacteria, algae, fungi and other organic materials. It often forms in damp and nutrient-rich environments, creating a slimy layer that adheres to various surfaces. In the context of HVAC systems, zooglea can thrive in the dark and moist corners of ducts, coils, drains and condensate pans.

2024-04-30 17:10:39 Heading 2: < Formation of Zooglea > MATCHED

2024-04-30 17:10:39 Block3_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	The formation of zooglea begins with microscopic organisms finding a suitable surface to attach to. In HVAC systems, this could be the inner surfaces of ductwork, coils or any component with persistent moisture. As these microorganisms multiply, they secrete a slimy substance that provides a protective environment, allowing the formation of a biofilm.

2024-04-30 17:10:39 Block3_Paragraph 2 MATCHED

	The increase in HVAC systems that use all aluminum coils seems to have accelerated the growth of zooglea. That's because these systems no longer have copper in their coils, which is a metal that can act as an antibacterial that helps bust the biofilms.

2024-04-30 17:10:39 Block5_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	The most common place you'll find zooglea is in the drain pans or the drain lines that carry moisture away from your HVAC system. While it's common for these areas to see a buildup of other biofilms, such as fungus and algae, what distinguishes zooglea is that it is a whitish gelatinous paste, which has earned it the unfortunate name of drain snot.

2024-04-30 17:10:39 Block5_Paragraph 2 MATCHED

	When deciding if you have a zooglea issue or not, be sure not to confuse the biofilm with the oil that sometimes coats the coils and drains in the system. This can also present as a white gluey substance. In general, if your system is new and you see such a substance, it's likely the oil, and you can get rid of it with a thorough cleaning by your HVAC professional. If the system is older, then it's likely zooglea.

	$2,000 and $5,200|https://homeguide.com/costs/gas-furnace-prices

2024-04-30 17:11:26 Block4_List 4 MATCHED

	Your climate. If you live in a region with harsh winters and prolonged heating needs, a high-efficiency furnace (90%+) could significantly reduce your energy bills over time. However, in milder climates, a mid-efficiency model (80%-90%) might offer an adequate balance between cost and efficiency. You should expect to pay between $2,000 and $5,200 (CAD 2,694 and CAD 7,004) for a mid-efficiency model.
Your budget. High-efficiency furnaces generally have a higher up-front cost. For example, a gas furnace installation will cost between $3,300 and $6,900 (CAD 4,445 and CAD 9,294). While they deliver long-term savings, the initial investment might not be feasible for everyone. Consider the payback period — how long it takes for the energy savings to offset the higher initial cost.
Environmental impact. If minimizing your carbon footprint is a priority, a high-efficiency furnace is the clear winner. Its lower fuel consumption translates to reduced greenhouse gas emissions.

	This practice can also reduce your energy bills and extend your heating system’s life. In this article, we’ll show you how to balance radiators step by step.

2024-04-30 17:12:07 Heading 1: < What Does It Mean to Balance Your Radiator? > MATCHED

2024-04-30 17:12:07 Block2_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	Balancing your radiator means ensuring each radiator in your home receives the right amount of hot water, according to its size and location. If they’re not balanced, some radiators may get too much hot water, while others may get too little. This causes uneven heating, cold spots and wasted energy. Balancing solves these problems by regulating the flow of hot water to each radiator using valves located on the pipework. Let’s look at the two types of valves you need to know about.

2024-04-30 17:12:07 Block2_Sub Heading 2 MATCHED

	Thermostatic Radiator Valves (TRVs)

2024-04-30 17:12:07 Block2_Paragraph 3 MATCHED

	TRVs are usually located on the side or the bottom of the radiator and have a numbered dial or a knob you can turn to adjust the heat level. They automatically adjust the flow of hot water to each radiator, depending on the room temperature and your preference. However, TRVs can sometimes malfunction or become inaccurate and may not work well with other valves in the system. Therefore, you may still need to balance your radiator manually using the other type of valve.

2024-04-30 17:12:07 Block2_Sub Heading 4 MATCHED

	Lockshield Valves

2024-04-30 17:12:07 Block2_Paragraph 5 MATCHED

	These are usually located on the opposite end of the radiator from the TRV and have a plastic cap that covers a small valve. They’re meant to be adjusted only when you need to balance your radiator. Lockshield valves can control the flow of hot water to each radiator by opening or closing the valve, using a radiator bleeding key or using an adjustable spanner.

	Step by Step

2024-04-30 17:12:08 Block3_Paragraph 4 MATCHED

	1. Turn off your heating system and let the radiators cool down completely.

2024-04-30 17:12:08 Block3_Paragraph 5 MATCHED

	2. Release trapped air with the bleeding key or adjustable spanner by opening the small valve located on the top or the side of each radiator, usually near the TRV.

2024-04-30 17:12:08 Block3_Paragraph 6 MATCHED

	3. First, you’ll hear a hissing sound as the air escapes, followed by dripping water. When this runs clear, close the valve.

2024-04-30 17:12:08 Block3_Paragraph 7 MATCHED

	4. Identify the radiator closest to the boiler, as this will be your reference point for balancing your other radiators.

2024-04-30 17:12:08 Block3_Paragraph 8 MATCHED

	5. Fully open this radiator’s lockshield valve with the radiator bleeding key or the spanner, turning it counterclockwise until it stops. (Open the TRV of this radiator by turning it to the highest setting.)

2024-04-30 17:12:08 Block3_Paragraph 9 MATCHED

	6. Turn on your heating system and wait for the radiators to heat up.

2024-04-30 17:12:08 Block3_Paragraph 10 MATCHED

	7. Use the digital thermometer to measure the temperature of the pipework near the TRV and the lockshield valve of the reference radiator. (Place the thermometer on the metal surface of the pipe and hold it until it gives a stable reading.)

2024-04-30 17:12:08 Block3_Paragraph 11 MATCHED

	8. Record the readings on your paper and calculate the difference between them. Ideally, the difference should be about 53.6 degrees F (12 degrees C). If the difference is more or less than that, you’ll need to adjust the lockshield valve of the reference radiator.

2024-04-30 17:12:08 Block3_Paragraph 12 MATCHED

	9. Go to the radiator that's furthest away from the boiler and repeat the same process from the fifth step (On your paper, also record the number of turns it took to open the valve to get the proper temperature difference so you can do this with more accuracy for subsequent radiators.)

2024-04-30 17:12:08 Block3_Paragraph 13 MATCHED

	10. Continue to balance the rest of the radiators in your home, following the same steps, working your way from the radiator furthest from the boiler to the one closest.

2024-04-30 17:12:08 Block3_Paragraph 14 MATCHED

	11. Turn off your heating system and wait for the radiators to cool down completely.

2024-04-30 17:12:08 Block3_Paragraph 15 MATCHED

	There's a wide array of radiator options available. Here's a brief breakdown of the most common types (not including installation costs).

2024-04-30 17:12:50 Block3_List 2 MATCHED

	Single panel: Because this type uses the least amount of material, it’s usually the most affordable option. Expect to pay between $100 and $300 (CAD 136 and CAD 406) if it’s the plumbed type and $100 to $450 (CAD 136 to CAD 609) for the electric version.
Double panel: This version typically uses twice as much material as a single panel radiator, so you should expect to pay more. Costs will likely be between $300 and $500 (CAD 406 and CAD 677) for plumbed versions and $300 to $1,500 (CAD 406 to CAD 2,030) for electrical ones.
Column: Column radiators are normally made from cast iron, steel or aluminum, giving them a classically elegant appearance. Costs reflect this, at between $500 and $1,200 (CAD 677 and CAD 1,624) for plumbed options and $300 and $1,400 (CAD 406 and CAD 1,894) for the electrical equivalent.
Flat panel: Plumbed versions of these slim, wall-mounted radiators typically cost between $200 and $1,200 (CAD 271 and CAD 1,624), while the electric type is between $300 and $900 (CAD 406 and CAD 1,218). However, you're likely to recoup some of your initial outlay through lower energy bills, as they're particularly energy-efficient.
Baseboard: The cost differences between plumbed and electric models aren’t as wide for this type of radiator. Both versions start at around $100 (CAD 136), but the plumbed version can be as much as $1,500 (CAD 2,030). The electric version could run up to $1,200 (CAD 1,624).

	Saltless water softeners are an alternative to regular salt water softeners to treat hard water. Unlike softeners with salt, they don't remove hard minerals from your water supply. Instead, they crystallize the minerals by changing their chemical state to minimize their effects.

2024-04-30 17:14:22 Block2_Paragraph 2 MATCHED

	Whole-house saltless water softeners attach to your plumbing system near the main water inlet, allowing water to flow through the unit for treatment before supplying your fixtures. You can also purchase smaller point-of-use units to soften the water supplying a single fixture, such as a shower or faucet.

2024-04-30 17:14:22 Block2_Paragraph 3 MATCHED

	Salt-free water softeners have a tank containing polymer beads called template-assisted crystallization media. The beads feature small depressions or craters that attract magnesium and calcium ions to create crystals. These crystals drop off when they reach the correct size and remain in your water supply.

2024-04-30 17:14:22 Block2_Paragraph 4 MATCHED

	Treating your water with a salt-free water softener can reduce limescale buildup in your pipes. It can also be a good option if you require a low-sodium diet. However, it's less effective at reducing issues such as soap scum buildup and skin dryness than salt-based models.

2024-04-30 17:14:23 Block4_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	How much it costs to install a saltless water softener depends on the system type. Generally, you should expect to pay a plumber $50 to $200 (CAD 68 to CAD 271) per hour for installation services.

2024-04-30 17:14:23 Block4_Paragraph 2 MATCHED

	Small, single-fixture models are cheaper to install, with most plumbers charging between $100 and $300 (CAD 136 and CAD 407) per unit. Meanwhile, the labor to install a whole-house saltless water softening system starts at around $300 (CAD 407) and could exceed $1,000 (CAD 1,357) for complex installations. You may pay more if you live in an expensive city or your plumber struggles to access your water main.

2024-04-30 17:15:11 Block2_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	Mold thrives in moist, dark places with minimal air circulation, making your fridge an ideal breeding ground. Moldy food is one of the most common causes of moldy odors. When you leave uncovered or improperly sealed food in the fridge for extended periods of time, mold can develop and lead to strong moldy or musty smells. Spilled foods and beverages can also cause moisture to pool on your refrigerator surfaces. Over time, these minor spills can evolve into messy mold.

2024-04-30 17:15:11 Block2_Paragraph 2 MATCHED

	The rubber seal on your refrigerator door is another common culprit of mold growth. If the seal pulls away slightly from the door surface, it can create a small crevice that's perfect for trapping moisture. When you open the refrigerator door, the cold air from inside the fridge meets the warmer air in your kitchen and creates condensation. If the condensation finds its way behind the loose seal, mold growth can occur.

	Moldy odors in your fridge without the presence of visible mold may be due to a moldy drip pan or moisture buildup in your refrigerator's internal drainage system. Drip pans sit beneath the fridge, and they should be cleaned every few months to prevent mold and mildew growth. If the issue is internal, it's always best to call in an experienced appliance repair professional to inspect your refrigerator and safely perform the necessary repairs.

	Air purifiers filter the air in a space to remove a variety of particles, including allergens like dust. The air is drawn into the air purifier, pushed through a filter or other structures and pumped back into the room cleaner than it was.

2024-04-30 17:22:28 Block2_Paragraph 2 MATCHED

	Most air purifiers work via the following mechanics:

2024-04-30 17:22:28 Block2_List 3 MATCHED

	A fan is used to move air, pulling it from the surrounding space into the air purifier.
The fan pushes the air through a filter, where pollutants are removed. Filters work either by forcing air through very small holes that other particles can't get through or by using electricity to attract particles like dander, pollen and dust.
The cleaned air is pushed back into the room.

2024-04-30 17:22:28 Block2_Paragraph 4 MATCHED

	Air purifiers typically work 24-7, constantly pulling in air in a space and pumping it back out again cleaner than it was. The same air in the room is cycled through the air purifier over and over to help reduce pollutants.

	People in the home have allergies. Air purifiers can help remove a variety of allergens in a space, reducing the severity of symptoms someone has to deal with in their own home.
Someone in the home has asthma. The same is true for protecting people with asthma. In some cases, dust or other air pollutants can trigger asthma symptoms, and an air purifier can cut down on those risks.
There are pets in the home. Pets can leave a lot of dander and other issues in the home, making it harder to keep an area clean and smelling fresh. An air purifier may be able to reduce those struggles.
The home is usually dusty. Depending on where you live, you may have more than an average amount of dust in your home. Homes in rural settings, those near open construction sites or residences with a gravel or dirt driveway are all prone to excessive amounts of dust accumulation. Air purifiers can help remove dust circulating in the air.

	Minerals in the water settle at the bottom of the tank, which reduces the appliance’s heating efficiency and can increase your energy costs as it consumes more energy to generate heat.
Exposure to corrosive elements in the water, most commonly found in areas with hard water, can weaken the element and cause it to fail.
Overheating due to an electrical issue or insufficient water levels in the tank can result in a complete loss of heating capacity.

2024-04-30 17:23:57 Block2_Paragraph 13 MATCHED

	An anode rod is a sacrificial metal rod, typically made of magnesium or aluminum, that’s embedded inside the water heater's tank. Its purpose is to be a sacrificial target for corrosion, preventing the tank from being damaged by minerals in the water. It becomes conductive when the water is heated, attracting corrosive minerals. Over time, the harsh water conditions gradually corrode the anode rod, reducing its ability to protect the tank. At some point, the anode rod will be fully consumed by minerals, and if it’s not replaced, the tank will begin to rust.

	So … It’s been a brick since you had your sewer line seen to, and now that’s come back to bite ya in the form of a major leak. Looking at all that (suspiciously brown) water in your lawn, it’s safe to say Georgia’s not the only thing on your mind. Now you’ve got dollar signs circling above your head like a cartoon character seeing stars. How much is this gonna cost? Not to worry: Sanitary sewer line maintenance and repair costs are lower in Georgia than the national average.

2024-04-30 17:26:54 Block1_Paragraph 3 MATCHED

	Your sanitary sewer system is a network of underground pipes that does the dirtiest of all household jobs: carrying sewage and greywater out and away from your home. When you brush your teeth, wash the dishes or flush the toilet, that water doesn’t just disappear. Your sewer line is responsible for carrying it to a wastewater treatment plant.

2024-04-30 17:26:54 Block1_Paragraph 4 MATCHED

	Sewer systems — marvels of modern plumbing — are designed to be out of sight and out of mind. But sometimes, they’ll make themselves known. Gurgling toilets, sewage smells, slow drains and puddles of sewer water in your yard are all symptoms of a sewer line backup. One odd presentation of a sewer-line leak is a particularly (and perhaps suspiciously) green patch of grass in your lawn. Why’s it so green? You can probably fill in the blanks.

2024-04-30 17:26:54 Block1_Paragraph 5 MATCHED

	In that case, you’re probably going to need repair. That involves digging a trench to access the line, breaking the pipe, removing the damaged section and replacing it with a new one. Trenchless repairs are a little easier (and cheaper) because of the lack of digging involved.

2024-04-30 17:26:54 Block1_Paragraph 6 MATCHED

	Don’t worry. We’ve anticipated your next question: What’s this bill going to look like?

2024-04-30 17:26:54 Block1_Paragraph 7 MATCHED

	Sewer line maintenance and repair costs vary wildly based on a number of factors, like the type of pipes you have and whether excavation work is needed. If the technicians are going to have to dig up your yard to get to your sewer line, the total price depends on anything from how deep your lines are buried to what type of soil they’ll have to dig through. And, of course, the local cost of living also plays a factor.

2024-04-30 17:26:54 Block1_Paragraph 8 MATCHED

	Regular maintenance can help prevent cracks that lead to major repairs, but this, too, comes at a price.

2024-04-30 17:26:54 Block1_Paragraph 9 MATCHED

	The national average cost for diagnosis is $83 (CAD 106), for maintenance is $408 (CAD 520) and repair is $3,708 (CAD 4,726).

2024-04-30 17:26:54 Block1_Paragraph 10 MATCHED

	Below, you’ll find the average service prices based on aggregated HomeServe data reported by our network of contractors across the Peach State, which should give you a good idea of how much you’ll have to pay for sanitary sewer line maintenance and repairs.

	Before they can get to work on your line, the technician will likely need to come out and run some tests to determine what’s wrong with your system. In Georgia, the fee for this is about 17% higher than the national average.

2024-04-30 17:26:54 Block3_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	If you want to avoid a larger sewer system breakdown, you’ll want to stay on top of regular maintenance and cleaning. A maintenance service call usually involves spraying your pipes with high-pressure water to clear any would-be clogs. The technician may also send a scope down the pipe to check for cracks and separations that could cause issues down the road.

2024-04-30 17:26:54 Block3_Paragraph 2 MATCHED

	In Georgia, you can expect to pay about 7% less than the national average for sewer line maintenance. Experts recommend large households have their pipes serviced once every two years.

	Shifting earth and invading tree roots can do a number on your sewer pipes. Over time, your pipes may separate or crack, causing leaks and full-on ruptures. Whatever the reason, if a technician says you’re going to need a sewer line repair, you should brace yourself for the accompanying costs.

2024-04-30 17:26:55 Block4_Paragraph 2 MATCHED

	Georgians spend, on average, 6% less on sewer line repairs than the average American.

	Many factors affect the cost of moving, including the size of your home, the number of items being moved, the distance you’re moving and whether you hire a professional moving company. By taking these factors into account, you can pick the lowest-stress option that still keeps you within your budget. Read on to get an idea of how much it’ll cost to move.

2024-04-30 17:27:39 Heading 1: < How Much Does It Cost to Move a Three-Bedroom House? > MATCHED

2024-04-30 17:27:39 Block2_Paragraph1_link 1 MATCHED

	Consumer Affairs|https://www.consumeraffairs.com/movers/how-much-do-movers-cost.html

2024-04-30 17:27:39 Block2_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	According to Consumer Affairs, the average cost to move a three-bedroom house is between $600 and $1,000 (CAD 820 and CAD 1,367). This price is for a local move using professional movers. Moving costs vary based on how much you’re moving and how far you’re going. The more items you need to move, the more it will cost. The cost is also dependent on the size of your home. A one-bedroom residence typically has fewer items than a three-bedroom home, so the cost of the move would be much lower — more like $240 to $500 (CAD 328 to CAD 683).

2024-04-30 17:27:39 Block2_Paragraph 2 MATCHED

	Long-distance moving costs are naturally higher. If you're moving more than 100 miles from your current location, the cost creeps up to around $5,000 (CAD 6,835). Longer moves, like a cross-country move, could send the cost up to as much as $10,000 (CAD 13,669). Simply put, the farther you move, the more it will cost.

2024-04-30 17:27:39 Heading 2: < How Much Does It Typically Cost to Hire Movers? > MATCHED

2024-04-30 17:27:40 Block3_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	For a local move, movers generally charge an hourly rate between $80 and $100 (CAD 109 and CAD 137) for a team of two. Larger teams will cost more per hour, but they'll also get the work done faster. That means fewer hours of work, so costs may equal out.

2024-04-30 17:27:40 Block3_Paragraph 2 MATCHED

	For long-distance moves, moving companies typically charge a flat rate based on the distance of the move. The greater the distance, the higher the price.

2024-04-30 17:27:40 Block3_Paragraph 3 MATCHED

	Also, consider how many items you have to move and the weight involved. Fewer and lighter items can be moved quicker, resulting in less moving time and cost. Conversely, heavier items like refrigerators and washing machines take longer for teams to move, which in turn costs you more money.

	Hiring a moving company costs more money than doing it yourself, but it can also save you time and stress.

	If you're considering a do-it-yourself move and think you can handle it, remember there are still costs involved. If you don’t have a vehicle big enough to transport larger furniture items, you’ll probably need to rent a truck or trailer. While this is cheaper than hiring a moving company, additional costs include mileage, gas refills and insurance liability, not to mention the physical cost of moving everything yourself.

	Depending on the size of truck you need, you may be able to pull off a local move for less than $100 if you can complete the job in a day, according to Forbes.

Remember, the cost of moving the pod to your new location can vary depending on the distance. While renting a pod is cheaper than hiring a moving company, you’ll still do all the heavy lifting yourself.

	All these moving costs may have you thinking … What if you just buy new furniture for your new home rather than messing with moving all the old stuff? It sounds simple, but new furniture can be costly.

	A refrigerator's defrost thermostat is a small device that regulates your freezer's defrost cycle. It’s located behind the back panel of the freezer compartment and measures the temperature of the evaporator coils. When the temperature is too high, it signals the heater to turn on and melt any ice that's formed on the coils. This prevents frost buildup and ensures proper cooling of the freezer.

2024-04-30 17:29:05 Block2_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	If you have an existing boiler, your installer will remove your current unit and clean your heating system. Next, they'll install your new boiler, which may mean upgrading your plumbing system to suit a more modern model. Finally, they'll test your system to ensure it functions correctly.

2024-04-30 17:29:05 Block2_Paragraph 2 MATCHED

	Generally, a straightforward like-for-like boiler installation takes around a day. However, the process may take longer (and be significantly more complicated) if you're switching to a different boiler type or have a very old heating system. For example, your plumber may need to upgrade your radiators or install your new boiler in a different position.

	According to Forbes, plumbers charge around $2,500 (CAD 3,362) on average to install a boiler, excluding the cost of the unit itself. Therefore, it's hardly surprising some homeowners wonder if they can cut costs by installing a new boiler themselves.

2024-04-30 17:29:05 Block3_Paragraph 2 MATCHED

	Installing a gas boiler yourself is rarely possible because fitting these units without a gas-safe certification is illegal. Therefore, you'll need to hire a professional to install your boiler to avoid falling afoul of the law unless you happen to have the correct certification.

2024-04-30 17:29:05 Block3_Paragraph 3 MATCHED

	In any event, installing any boiler without extensive experience is challenging because the wiring and plumbing involved are beyond the abilities of even the most competent DIYers. You may also struggle to obtain building approval without hiring a suitably qualified plumber.

2024-04-30 17:29:05 Block5_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	Unless you're an experienced plumber, installing your own boiler is rarely a good idea. Unless you know what you're doing, you risk installing your boiler incorrectly. Incorrect installation can prevent you from getting building approval, so you may end up having to hire a professional to reinstall your unit. Therefore, attempting DIY installation could turn out to be more expensive than hiring a pro in the first place.

2024-04-30 17:29:06 Block5_Paragraph 2 MATCHED

	However, building approval issues aren't the only potential pitfall of installing your own boiler. Installing a boiler heating system requires complex electrical and plumbing work (and gas work if you have a gas-powered model). Making a mistake during the installation could increase your risk of leaks, floods and a malfunctioning heating system. Furthermore, incorrect wiring or gas connections could cause a house fire or allow natural gas to enter your living space, potentially causing serious health issues or even explosions.

2024-04-30 17:57:19 Block2_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	An HVAC register, or a supply vent, delivers heated or cooled air from the central unit throughout your home. Every room that's connected to your HVAC system has at least one register in it, but some have more registers depending on the size. You can tell you're dealing with an HVAC register if you feel air blowing out of it when the system is on.

2024-04-30 17:57:19 Block2_Paragraph 2 MATCHED

	Your home also has return vents, which pull air back to the main HVAC unit. They're usually larger than the registers, and they don't have louvers you can close like HVAC registers do. If you hold a piece of paper up to a return vent while the system is running, it should suction the paper to the grate slightly. You also won't feel air blowing out of a return vent.

2024-04-30 17:57:19 Heading 2: < Where Are They Located? > MATCHED

2024-04-30 17:57:19 Block3_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	Builders install HVAC registers strategically in each room to maximize energy efficiency. In older homes, you'll likely find the HVAC registers on the floor near your walls. New construction home builders typically install them on the wall near the ceiling or in the ceiling. The higher location helps the air circulate better, and the registers are less likely to get blocked by furniture or curtains.

	Every system should have a main HVAC filter in the central unit inside the home. All the air that circulates through the heating and cooling system goes through that filter to remove debris. Some homes also have HVAC register filters as an extra air quality measure. They sit directly behind the cover of your registers or return vents.

2024-04-30 17:57:19 Block4_Paragraph 2 MATCHED

	To determine if a vent has a filter, look through the slats to see if something is sitting behind the cover. Filters are typically white. You can also remove the cover to check behind it. Floor register covers often pull up without anything holding them in place. Wall and ceiling vents usually have two screws to secure them, so you'll need to remove the fasteners first. Filters for supply vents are usually thin and flexible, so they fit under the louvers. Return vent filters often look like regular HVAC filters with a cardboard frame.

	Filters in your vents are optional, but they can offer a little extra air filtration. You might add them if you're concerned about allergens, if you have pets or if your home is particularly dusty. They don't replace your regular HVAC filter, though, so continue changing that filter regularly. Vent filters also aren't as efficient as main filters.

	Familiarizing yourself with the parts of your HVAC system can help you determine if everything is working correctly.

2024-04-30 17:58:41 Heading 1: < What Is an HVAC Register, and Where Is It Located? > MATCHED

2024-04-30 17:58:41 Block2_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	A supply vent, sometimes called an HVAC register, is the grate-covered opening where heated or cooled air enters the room. When your HVAC system is running, you should feel air blowing out of the supply vents. You can think of your home comfort system as a circular motion. The furnace or AC pulls air from your home through the return vents, into the unit to heat or cool it and back into your home through the HVAC register system.

2024-04-30 17:58:41 Block2_Paragraph 2 MATCHED

	The location of supply vents varies based on what the builder decides. You can find them on the floor near the edges of the room, on the wall or on the ceiling. Vents in older homes are typically on the floor, while newer homes often have them on the ceiling or high on the wall. Air tends to circulate better when the vents are higher in the room, and there's a lower chance of them getting blocked.

2024-04-30 17:58:41 Block3_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	The return air vent is similar, but no air blows out of it. Instead, air from the room goes through the HVAC return vent and back to the main part of the system. From there, the air goes through the filter to remove contaminants. The system then heats or cools the air again. Having the right balance of supply and return vents helps keep the air circulating.

2024-04-30 17:58:41 Block3_Paragraph 2 MATCHED

	Return vents often go near the floor on an interior wall. An ideal location is opposite the side of the supply vents to increase circulation. Most homes have fewer return vents than supply vents. Older homes often have only one return vent per floor, but newer construction homes may have one return vent per room. Keeping your return vents clear helps the system work efficiently.

2024-04-30 17:58:41 Block4_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	Both a supply vent and a return air vent have a grill-style cover over the opening. However, an HVAC return is often larger than a supply vent. Plus, the grills on supply vents usually have dampers built into them that you can adjust to open or close the vent. This controls how much air flows into that room. Return vents need to have a constant flow of air through them back to the main heating and cooling unit, so they don't have dampers on them.

2024-04-30 17:58:41 Block4_Paragraph 2 MATCHED

	To identify which type of vent you're looking at, make sure your HVAC system is running. It can be on the heating or cooling setting. You may have to wait a few minutes for it to start blowing if you're just turning it on. Hold your hand next to the grate. If you feel air blowing out of it, you're dealing with a supply vent. If you feel a slight suction, it's a return vent. Holding a piece of paper to the vent can also help you differentiate between the two. A return vent should suction the paper against the grate, while a supply vent will blow it away. You can also look for a little lever, which controls the damper on a supply vent. If you don't see one, it's likely a return vent.

2024-04-30 17:59:37 Block2_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	Iron ochre, also known as iron bacteria or iron oxide, is a naturally occurring substance that forms when iron-rich groundwater comes into contact with oxygen. This interaction fosters the growth of iron bacteria, resulting in the formation of slimy, reddish-brown deposits. While it may resemble rust, iron ochre is a combination of iron and organic material produced by bacteria.

2024-04-30 17:59:37 Heading 2: < Where, When and How Does It Form? > MATCHED

2024-04-30 17:59:37 Block3_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	Iron ochre is commonly found in areas with high levels of iron in the groundwater. It tends to form in damp, oxygen-rich environments, such as drainage pipes and sump pits. Factors such as a high water table, poor drainage and organic matter provide the ideal conditions for its growth. Iron ochre can develop over time, gradually accumulating and causing blockages in drainage systems. It’s difficult to pinpoint a specific time because several variables are at play, such as bacteria levels and oxygen exposure. It can be anywhere from weeks to years.

2024-04-30 17:59:37 Block4_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	The presence of iron ochre poses several problems for homeowners, particularly those with sump pumps. First, it can clog drain pipes, impeding the flow of water and increasing the risk of flooding. Additionally, iron ochre buildup can damage sump pump components, leading to malfunctions and costly repairs. The foul odor it emits can permeate the air, creating an unpleasant environment in basements and crawl spaces. Left untreated, iron ochre can compromise the effectiveness of basement waterproofing systems, leaving your home vulnerable to water damage.

	Nestled in the heart of homes across the country, boilers work tirelessly, silently transforming fuel into warmth to chase away the cold. But how does a boiler work? We’re going to delve into its inner workings and reveal the fascinating interplay of physics, engineering and comfort. So, settle in and let's see how this unsung hero can keep your home toasty warm.

2024-04-30 18:00:25 Heading 1: < What Is a Boiler? > MATCHED

2024-04-30 18:00:25 Block2_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	A boiler is a closed vessel containing water or steam, which is heated by a fuel source and then circulated through pipes, radiators or underfloor heating systems. Its purpose is to warm rooms and provide hot water for faucets and showers. Boilers can also be connected to thermostats, letting you control your heating and hot water temperatures.

2024-04-30 18:00:25 Heading 2: < What Are the Types of Boilers? > MATCHED

2024-04-30 18:00:25 Block3_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	There are three main types of boiler heating systems, each with pros and cons, including different costs, levels of efficiency and eco-friendliness.

2024-04-30 18:00:25 Block3_Sub Heading 2 MATCHED

	Combi Boilers

2024-04-30 18:00:25 Block3_Paragraph 3 MATCHED

	Combi, or combination, boilers provide heating and hot water from a single unit without the need for a separate hot water cylinder or tank. They’re compact, efficient and easy to install, making them ideal for smaller homes and apartments. However, homes with larger families may find them wanting, as their capacity for producing heat and hot water isn’t as great as the next two options.

2024-04-30 18:00:25 Block3_Sub Heading 4 MATCHED

	System Boilers

2024-04-30 18:00:25 Block3_Paragraph 5 MATCHED

	These are similar to combi boilers but have a separate hot water cylinder that stores the hot water until needed. System boilers are more efficient than conventional boilers as they don’t have a cold water tank that can lose heat. However, they take up more space than combi boilers and are often the costliest of the three types of boilers covered here.

2024-04-30 18:00:25 Block3_Sub Heading 6 MATCHED

	Conventional Boilers

2024-04-30 18:00:25 Block3_Paragraph 7 MATCHED

	These are the oldest and most traditional types of boilers. They have a hot water cylinder and a cold water tank, which are usually located in the basement, a utility room or a dedicated room. They’re suitable for larger homes, especially those with low water pressure. However, they take up more space and require more pipework.

2024-04-30 18:00:25 Heading 3: < How Does a Boiler Heat Water? > MATCHED

2024-04-30 18:00:25 Block4_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	The type of fuel plays a crucial part in how boilers heat water. There are three main types: gas, oil and electricity. Each has its advantages and disadvantages, depending on its availability, cost and environmental impact.

2024-04-30 18:00:25 Block4_Sub Heading 2 MATCHED

	Gas Boilers

2024-04-30 18:00:25 Block4_Paragraph 3 MATCHED

	Gas boilers use natural gas, which is supplied by the local gas company through gas lines. They’re cheaper and more eco-friendly than oil or electric boilers, as gas is a cleaner and more efficient fuel. They work by burning gas in a combustion chamber, which creates heat that's transferred to the water or steam in the boiler. Gas boilers require a flue or chimney to vent the waste gases and a condensate pipe to drain the excess water.

2024-04-30 18:00:25 Block4_Sub Heading 4 MATCHED

	Oil Boilers

2024-04-30 18:00:26 Block4_Paragraph 5 MATCHED

	Oil boilers are a solution when homes aren’t connected to a gas network. The oil is transported by trucks and stored in a tank on the property. Oil boilers are more expensive and less eco-friendly than gas, as oil is a fossil fuel that produces more carbon emissions and requires more maintenance. The boilers work by spraying oil into a combustion chamber, where it’s ignited by a spark, generating heat that’s transferred to the water or steam in the boiler. Like gas, oil boilers require a flue or chimney to vent the waste gases and a condensate pipe to drain the excess water.

2024-04-30 18:00:26 Block4_Sub Heading 6 MATCHED

	Electric Boilers

2024-04-30 18:00:26 Block4_Paragraph 7 MATCHED

	Another option for homes not connected to a gas network is an electric boiler. Supplied by the main electricity network, they’re cheaper and easier to install than gas or oil boilers, as they don’t require a flue, chimney or condensate pipe. They’re also more eco-friendly, as they don’t produce any carbon emissions or waste gases. Electric boilers work by using an electric element to heat the water or steam in the boiler.

2024-04-30 18:00:26 Heading 4: < How Does a Boiler Distribute Heat? > MATCHED

2024-04-30 18:00:26 Block5_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	The heated water (or steam) travels through pipes installed throughout the house. Unlike forced air systems, such as HVAC, there are no ducts involved. The heat reaches individual rooms through different methods, such as:

2024-04-30 18:00:26 Block5_List 2 MATCHED

	Radiators
Baseboards, which are similar to radiators but smaller and installed along the base of walls
Radiant (underfloor) heating
Hydronic air handlers

2024-04-30 18:00:26 Block5_Paragraph 3 MATCHED

	Once the water cools down after releasing its heat, it flows back to the boiler to be reheated, completing the cycle.

2024-04-30 18:00:26 Block5_Paragraph 4 MATCHED

	Finally, some other points to remember about how boilers work are that they distribute heat more evenly than forced-air systems while also providing hot water. However, depending on local conditions, they might be slower to respond to thermostat changes than furnaces.

	Carbon monoxide: Carbon monoxide or CO is a gas present in burning fuel. It's odorless and colorless, and high levels of CO in the home can cause illness in both humans and animals.
Radon: Radon is a natural gas that forms when certain metals in soil and water break down. Radon can make its way inside homes through cracks and gaps. While this gas is natural, constant exposure may increase the risk of developing lung cancer.
Particulate matter: Particulate matter refers to tiny particles that circulate through the air. Dust, cigarette smoke, dirt and soot are some examples of particulate pollutants.
Volatile organic compounds (VOCs): VOCs are gases created from products such as paint, cleaning solutions and air fresheners. Wood-burning stoves and tobacco products can also emit VOCs.

	Things You’ll Need:

2024-04-30 18:06:19 Block2_List 2 MATCHED

	A pair of gloves
A garbage bag suitable for the trash compactor
A sponge or cloth
Dish detergent
Warm water
Baking soda
A germ-killing deodorant spray
A vacuum cleaner or a broom and dustpan
A new charcoal air filter (optional)

	Step-by-Step Instructions:

2024-04-30 18:06:19 Block2_Paragraph 4 MATCHED

	1. Unplug the trash compactor from the power outlet and turn off the circuit breaker if necessary. This will reduce the chances of accidents or injuries while you’re cleaning.

2024-04-30 18:06:19 Block2_Paragraph 5 MATCHED

	2. Carefully remove the trash bag and dispose of it properly. You may need to use the manual lever to release the ram if it’s stuck.

2024-04-30 18:06:19 Block2_Paragraph 6 MATCHED

	3. Wipe down the inside of the trash compactor with a sponge or cloth dampened with warm water and dish detergent. Pay attention to the corners, crevices and hinges where trash may be left behind. Rinse the sponge or cloth frequently and wring it out well so you’re not reapplying grime or grease as you wipe.

2024-04-30 18:06:19 Block2_Paragraph 7 MATCHED

	4. Sprinkle some baking soda on the bottom and sides of the trash compactor. This will help neutralize any odors and absorb remaining moisture. Let it sit for about 15 minutes so it can work its magic, and then vacuum or sweep it up.

2024-04-30 18:06:19 Block2_Paragraph 8 MATCHED

	5. Spray a germ-killing deodorant on the inside of the trash compactor, especially on the ram and the door, where germs are more likely to linger. This will help disinfect and deodorize it. Let it dry completely before using the compactor again.

2024-04-30 18:06:19 Block2_Paragraph 9 MATCHED

	6. If your trash compactor has a charcoal air filter, you may want to replace it with a new one. The charcoal air filter helps reduce the smell, but it can get clogged or saturated over time. Check the manufacturer’s instructions on how to change the filter and how often to do it because not all compactors follow the same process.

2024-04-30 18:06:19 Block2_Paragraph 10 MATCHED

	7. Pull out the trash compactor from the cabinet or wall and clean behind it with a vacuum cleaner or a broom and dustpan. Wipe down the back and sides of the trash compactor with a damp cloth and dish detergent. When it’s dry, push it back into place and plug it in.

2024-04-30 18:06:19 Block2_Paragraph 11 MATCHED

	8. Replace the trash bag with a new one, making sure the bag fits snugly and securely around the bin. You can use a regular garbage bag or a specially designed trash compactor bag. Purpose-designed bags are typically more durable and resistant to punctures, so you might not have to clean them as often if you’re using them.

	Luckily, there’s a simple and affordable solution: air vent deflectors.

2024-04-30 18:07:02 Heading 1: < What Are Air Vent Deflectors? > MATCHED

2024-04-30 18:07:02 Block2_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	Air vent deflectors, also known as vent diverters, vent covers or vent shields, are devices that fit over your air vents and change the direction of the air that comes out of them. They’re usually made of plastic, metal or wood and come in various shapes, sizes and colors. Some are adjustable, meaning you can change the deflector’s angle or position to suit your needs. Some are magnetic, so they stick to your metal air vents without tools or screws. They can also be decorative, blending in with your wall or floor, or simply adding another style to your room.

2024-04-30 18:07:02 Heading 2: < How Do They Work? > MATCHED

2024-04-30 18:07:02 Block3_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	Deflectors point the air coming from your air vents in a different direction, depending on how you set them up. For example, if you have a floor vent that blows cold air at your feet, you can position the deflector to redirect the air upwards or sideways, removing the discomfort and improving the circulation and distribution of the air in the room. Similarly, if you have a ceiling vent that blows hot air directly at your head, the deflector can redirect the air toward the floor or a wall. Although not as common, some deflectors include filters to trap airborne pollutants, such as dust and pollen.

2024-04-30 18:07:02 Block4_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	Installing air vent deflectors is usually simple and quick, depending on the type and model. Here are some general steps to follow:

2024-04-30 18:07:02 Block4_Paragraph 2 MATCHED

	1. Measure the size and shape of the air vent and choose an air vent deflector that fits and satisfies your design preference.

2024-04-30 18:07:02 Block4_Paragraph 3 MATCHED

	2. Clean the air vent and the surrounding area so there are no obstructions that might make it harder for you to install the deflector.

2024-04-30 18:07:02 Block4_Paragraph 4 MATCHED

	3. Attach it to the air vent following the manufacturer’s instructions. You may need to use some tools or screws if it’s not a magnetic vent.

2024-04-30 18:07:03 Block4_Paragraph 5 MATCHED

	4. Adjust the angle or position of the air vent deflector to redirect the air. Use your hand or a thermometer to test the airflow.

	The high-velocity system is the new kid on the HVAC block. These systems offer several improvements on all that have come before.

2024-04-30 18:07:48 Heading 1: < What Is a High-Velocity HVAC System? > MATCHED

2024-04-30 18:07:48 Block2_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	High-velocity air conditioning is a modern type of heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system. Unlike conventional HVAC, which uses large, rigid ducts and low-pressure air, a high-velocity HVAC system can fit into tight spaces, reduce energy consumption and improve indoor air quality.

2024-04-30 18:07:49 Block2_Paragraph 2 MATCHED

	It uses a central air handler and a network of small, flexible ducts to distribute cool or warm air in your home. The air handler is a unit containing a fan, a coil and a filter. The fan draws air from the outside or a return duct and passes it through the coil, where it’s either cooled or heated by a refrigerant or a heat pump. The filter removes dust, pollen and other contaminants from the air. The air handler then sends the conditioned air to the ducts, which are about 2 inches in diameter and made of flexible plastic or metal.

2024-04-30 18:07:49 Block2_Paragraph 3 MATCHED

	The ducts run through the walls, ceilings, floors or crawl spaces of your home and connect to small outlets or vents, which are about 5 inches in diameter and can be round, square or rectangular. The air exits the outlets or vents at a high speed, creating a gentle suction that draws the room air into the air stream. This creates a continuous circulation of air that mixes the conditioned air with the room air, resulting in a uniform, comfortable temperature throughout your home.

2024-04-30 18:07:49 Heading 2: < How Does a High-Velocity HVAC System Work? > MATCHED

2024-04-30 18:07:49 Block3_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	It works by creating a phenomenon called aspiration, which is the process of mixing two streams of air with different temperatures and velocities. As the conditioned air exits the outlets or vents at a high speed, it creates a low-pressure zone around it, which causes the room air to be drawn into the air stream. The room air then mixes with the conditioned air, creating one comfortable temperature.

2024-04-30 18:07:49 Block3_Paragraph 2 MATCHED

	The system also removes excess humidity from the air, which can make you feel cooler and more comfortable in the summer and prevent mold and mildew growth in your home. To achieve this, it uses a cooling coil that lowers the temperature of the air below its dew point, which is the temperature at which the air can no longer hold water vapor. The excess water vapor then condenses on the coil and drains away, leaving the air dry and cool. It also uses filters to improve air quality by preventing the infiltration of dust, pollen and other pollutants.

	There are several types currently on the market. Below are three popular types, all of which use either a conventional air conditioner or heat pump or a hydronic coil that connects to a boiler or water heater.

2024-04-30 18:07:49 Block4_Sub Heading 2 MATCHED

	The Unico System

2024-04-30 18:07:49 Block4_Paragraph 3 MATCHED

	This is one of the most popular and widely used high-velocity HVAC systems in the world. It’s designed to fit into any space, regardless of the age, size or style of your home. The Unico System uses a modular air handler that can be installed in an attic, basement, closet or crawl space and a series of small, flexible ducts that can run through any existing cavities in your home. It uses a sound attenuator and a plenum, which are devices that reduce the noise and vibration of the air handler and the ducts.

2024-04-30 18:07:49 Block4_Sub Heading 4 MATCHED

	The SpacePak System

2024-04-30 18:07:49 Block4_Paragraph 5 MATCHED

	The SpacePak System uses a cylindrical air handler that can be installed horizontally or vertically. Its ducts are also small and flexible, but unlike the Unico system, they're insulated and wrapped with a vapor barrier. It employs sound attenuation and a plenum but cleverly integrates them within the air handler for a streamlined look.

2024-04-30 18:07:49 Block4_Sub Heading 6 MATCHED

	The Hi-Velocity System

2024-04-30 18:07:49 Block4_Paragraph 7 MATCHED

	The Hi-Velocity System uses a smart air handler that adjusts its speed and output according to demand and the conditions of your home. Its series of ducts are the smallest of all — about 1 inch in diameter — and made of durable polyester. A sound attenuator and a plenum are also present in this system, but they're smaller and more compact than the other systems.

	Switching from a gas furnace to an electric one can be a great option for you and your loved ones. Electric furnaces are increasingly popular because they’re easier to maintain than gas, as well as being safer and cheaper to run.

	The process of switching from a gas furnace to an electric one involves several steps.

2024-04-30 18:19:40 Block2_List 2 MATCHED

	Choosing an electric furnace. There are different types of electric furnaces, including electric heat pump, electric resistance and electric hybrid. Each type has its pros and cons, depending on your climate, home size and energy needs. You’ll need to compare the features, performance and efficiency of each type to find the one that suits your situation best.
Checking your electrical system. Electric furnaces need a higher voltage and amperage than gas furnaces, which means you’ll probably need to upgrade your electrical wiring, circuit breaker and outlet to handle the increased load. For this job, you’ll have to hire a licensed electrician to inspect your electrical system and make the necessary changes.
Removing your gas furnace. You’ll need to disconnect your gas furnace from the gas line, the ductwork and the thermostat. Additionally, you’ll also need to cap off the gas line and seal the vent pipe. These jobs should be left to professionals. You can sell, donate or recycle your old gas furnace, depending on its condition and age.
Installing your electric furnace. Your electric furnace will have to be connected to the electrical wiring, the ductwork and the thermostat. You'll also need to install a new air filter and a condensate drain, which you can do yourself if you have the know-how, or you can hire a professional.

Electrical system upgrade: $1,300 to $2,500 (CAD 1,739 to CAD 3,344), depending on the electrician's rate, the wiring complexity and the outlet location. You can save money by comparing quotes from different electricians, or by doing it yourself if you have the skills and tools. Warning: If you’re doing it yourself, ensure you follow all safety precautions to keep you and your home safe.
Gas furnace removal: $150 to $400 (CAD 201 to CAD 535), depending on how you dispose of your old gas furnace. You can save money by selling, donating or recycling your old gas furnace or by hauling it away yourself.
Electric furnace installation: $850 to $4,000 (CAD 1,137 to CAD 5,350), depending on the installer's rate, permits and inspections and the installation difficulty. You can save money by installing the furnace yourself or by negotiating a lower price with the installer.

	As stated above, electricians may charge anywhere from $40 to $120 (CAD 54 to CAD 161) per hour. Hiring one is a good first step before making the switch because they can let you know whether any wiring needs updating, since electric stoves use more electricity to operate compared to gas models.

	Several factors determine the cost of switching from a gas to an electric water heater. Let’s look at the most common ones in more detail.

2024-04-30 18:21:00 Block3_Sub Heading 2 MATCHED

	The Size and Type of Electric Water Heater

	HomeGuide|https://homeguide.com/costs/water-heater-installation-cost

2024-04-30 18:21:00 Block3_Paragraph 3 MATCHED

	Electric water heaters come in different sizes and types, such as tank and tankless, and have different capacities and features. Generally, the larger and more advanced the electric water heater, the more expensive it is. For example, HomeGuide says one with a standard tank costs between $600 and $1,800 (CAD 804 and CAD 2,412), while a tankless version can cost between $800 and $3,500 (CAD 1,072 and CAD 4,689).

2024-04-30 18:21:00 Block3_Sub Heading 4 MATCHED

	The Installation Costs

2024-04-30 18:21:00 Block3_Paragraph 5 MATCHED

	The costs for installation depend on the complexity and duration of the job, the location and accessibility of the water heater and the labor rates of the plumber or electrician you hire. The installation costs can also include the costs of removing the old gas water heater, upgrading the electrical panel or wiring and obtaining the necessary permits and inspections. The average installation cost of an electric water heater with a tank can range from $500 to $2,100 (CAD 670 to CAD 2,813). If you opt for the tankless version, expect to pay in the region of $600 to $2,500 (CAD 804 to CAD 3,349).

	The Operating Costs

2024-04-30 18:21:01 Block3_Paragraph 9 MATCHED

	While homeowners naturally budget for the installation costs, it’s equally important to consider the operating costs because, over time, these will have more of an impact on your wallet. The operating costs can depend on the appliance’s energy efficiency and your usage, as well as the electricity rates in your area. Electric water heaters are generally less energy-efficient than gas water heaters, as they use more electricity to heat water. However, they can also have lower maintenance and repair costs, as they have fewer parts and don’t require venting. The average annual operating cost of an electric water heater with a tank can be around $440 and $580 (CAD 590 and CAD 777). For a tankless version, expect to pay around $300 to $535 (CAD 402 to CAD 717).

2024-04-30 18:21:01 Block3_Paragraph 10 MATCHED

	Therefore, the total cost of replacing a gas water heater with an electric water heater can be anywhere between $1,100 and $5,600 (CAD 1,473 and CAD 7,497). The differences are wide because of the cost differences between tank and tankless options. You should also consider other potential savings and benefits of switching, such as:

2024-04-30 18:21:01 Block3_List 11 MATCHED

	Reducing your carbon footprint, especially if your electricity comes from renewable energy sources, such as solar or wind
Increasing your safety by eliminating the risk of gas leaks, explosions and carbon monoxide poisoning
Improving your comfort and convenience by having more control over the temperature and flow of hot water, as well as having more options over the appliance's size and location

2024-04-30 18:22:59 Block2_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	Smart registers are HVAC air vents fitted with a controller that automatically adjusts the volume of air coming into a room from the air conditioning ducting. Each smart vent has a thermostat either fitted to the unit or mounted on the wall that precisely controls the room temperature. Smart vents help optimize home heating and cooling and reduce energy bills. They help eliminate cold rooms in winter and hot rooms in summer.

2024-04-30 18:22:59 Block3_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	Smart air vents control the temperature in a room by automatically adjusting the volume of air coming out of the ducts. If the room is too cold in summer, the vents close to restrict the amount of cool air flowing into the room. If the room is too hot, the vent opens to allow more cool air into the room. They work best when all air vents in a room are converted.

2024-04-30 18:22:59 Heading 3: < Types of Smart Vents > MATCHED

2024-04-30 18:22:59 Block4_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	There are two types of smart air vents:

2024-04-30 18:22:59 Block4_List 2 MATCHED

	Static vents with adjustable vanes: These vents have motorized vanes to control airflow. They typically use battery power or a low-voltage AC power adaptor. Their battery life is good. Adjustable vents are best when there's a good flow of warm or cool air through the ducts.
Smart booster fan vents: Register booster fans increase the flow of warm or cool air into the room. They’re effective for adjusting room temperature quickly and are almost exclusively AC-powered.

2024-04-30 18:22:59 Block4_Paragraph 3 MATCHED

	Smart air vents use a thermostat to control the temperature in the room. Some have a built-in thermostat, while others communicate wirelessly to a wall-mounted thermostat. Most are compatible with smart thermostats and standard HVAC thermostats.

	Smart registers and air vents are Wi-Fi compatible. The most common method of setting them up is to use an app on your smartphone, but some models also have PC apps. Kits consist of one or more smart vents, a smart thermostat for each room and a hub that communicates with your smartphone.  The hub also communicates with your smart home thermostat. To simplify the system and save money, some manufacturers use one of the room thermostats as the hub.

	But before you rush out to buy a smart thermostat, there’s something you should know. Your home needs to have a special wire that’s crucial for the device to work properly. It’s called a C-wire, or common wire.

2024-04-30 18:25:00 Heading 1: < What Is a C-Wire? > MATCHED

2024-04-30 18:25:00 Block2_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	A C-wire is a low-voltage wire that provides continuous power to your thermostat. Unlike traditional thermostats that only use two or four wires to control the heating and cooling system, smart thermostats require more power to run their advanced features, such as Wi-Fi connectivity, touchscreen display, sensors and voice control. A C-wire acts as a neutral or ground wire that completes the circuit and delivers the extra power your smart thermostat needs.

2024-04-30 18:25:00 Heading 2: < Why Is It Needed to Install a Smart Thermostat? > MATCHED

2024-04-30 18:25:00 Block3_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	Without a C-wire, your smart thermostat may not work properly or at all. Some smart thermostats, such as Nest thermostats, claim they can work without a C-wire by using a technique called power stealing. This means they draw small amounts of power from the heating and cooling wires when the system is not running. However, this can cause problems, such as short cycling, battery drain, inconsistent performance and damage to your HVAC system. Therefore, it’s wise to have a C-wire installed to ensure the reliability and safety of your smart thermostat.

2024-04-30 18:25:00 Heading 3: < How Do I Know If My Home Has a C-Wire? > MATCHED

2024-04-30 18:25:00 Block4_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	The easiest way to check if your home has a C-wire is to look at your existing thermostat. First, you need to turn off the power to your HVAC system and remove the thermostat cover. Then, look at the wires connected to the terminals on the thermostat base. If you see a wire labeled C, COM or COMMON, that means you have a C-wire. If you don’t see a C-wire, you may still have one hidden behind the wall or in the furnace. You can use a multimeter to test the voltage of the wires or, if you’re not comfortable testing voltages, consult a professional to confirm if the C-wire is there.

	If your home doesn’t have a C-wire, you have a few options to install a smart thermostat. One option is to use a C-wire adapter, also known as a power extender kit. This is a device that creates a C-wire by using an existing wire in your HVAC system. You need to install the adapter near your furnace or air handler and connect it to the wires running to your thermostat.

2024-04-30 18:25:00 Block5_Paragraph 2 MATCHED

	Another option is to use a plug-in transformer, which is a device that plugs into a standard wall outlet and provides a C-wire to your thermostat. You need to run a wire from the transformer to your thermostat, which may require drilling holes or using a wire cover.

2024-04-30 18:25:01 Block5_Paragraph 3 MATCHED

	A third option is to hire a professional to install a new C-wire for you. The technician may run a new wire from your furnace to your thermostat or replace your existing thermostat cable with a new one that has a C-wire.

2024-04-30 18:25:01 Block5_Paragraph 4 MATCHED

	If you choose the first or second options, make sure you know exactly what you’re doing before you begin. Also, never work with electrical equipment until you’ve turned the power off at the mains, and always practice safety precautions. Follow these simple safety steps and soon you’ll be enjoying the comfort, convenience and financial benefits that smart thermostats are renowned for.

	Switching from a gas furnace to an electric one can be a great option for you and your loved ones. Electric furnaces are increasingly popular because they’re easier to maintain than gas, as well as being safer and cheaper to run.

2024-04-30 18:35:33 Heading 1: < What Is the Process of Switching From a Gas Furnace to an Electric One? > MATCHED

	The process of switching from a gas furnace to an electric one involves several steps.

2024-04-30 18:35:33 Block2_List 2 MATCHED

	Choosing an electric furnace. There are different types of electric furnaces, including electric heat pump, electric resistance and electric hybrid. Each type has its pros and cons, depending on your climate, home size and energy needs. You’ll need to compare the features, performance and efficiency of each type to find the one that suits your situation best.
Checking your electrical system. Electric furnaces need a higher voltage and amperage than gas furnaces, which means you’ll probably need to upgrade your electrical wiring, circuit breaker and outlet to handle the increased load. For this job, you’ll have to hire a licensed electrician to inspect your electrical system and make the necessary changes.
Removing your gas furnace. You’ll need to disconnect your gas furnace from the gas line, the ductwork and the thermostat. Additionally, you’ll also need to cap off the gas line and seal the vent pipe. These jobs should be left to professionals. You can sell, donate or recycle your old gas furnace, depending on its condition and age.
Installing your electric furnace. Your electric furnace will have to be connected to the electrical wiring, the ductwork and the thermostat. You'll also need to install a new air filter and a condensate drain, which you can do yourself if you have the know-how, or you can hire a professional.

	The total cost of switching depends on several factors, including the price of the electric furnace, the cost of the electrical system upgrade, the cost of the gas furnace removal and the cost of the electric furnace installation. Here’s a breakdown of the average costs for each component. (Pricing information via HomeGuide.)

2024-04-30 18:35:34 Block3_List 2 MATCHED

	Electric furnace: $600 to $2,600 (CAD 803 to CAD 3,478) depending on the furnace type, size, brand and efficiency level. You can save money by looking for discounts, rebates or sales or by buying a used or refurbished model.
Electrical system upgrade: $1,300 to $2,500 (CAD 1,739 to CAD 3,344), depending on the electrician's rate, the wiring complexity and the outlet location. You can save money by comparing quotes from different electricians, or by doing it yourself if you have the skills and tools. Warning: If you’re doing it yourself, ensure you follow all safety precautions to keep you and your home safe.
Gas furnace removal: $150 to $400 (CAD 201 to CAD 535), depending on how you dispose of your old gas furnace. You can save money by selling, donating or recycling your old gas furnace or by hauling it away yourself.
Electric furnace installation: $850 to $4,000 (CAD 1,137 to CAD 5,350), depending on the installer's rate, permits and inspections and the installation difficulty. You can save money by installing the furnace yourself or by negotiating a lower price with the installer.

	Electric water heaters come in different sizes and types, such as tank and tankless, and have different capacities and features. Generally, the larger and more advanced the electric water heater, the more expensive it is. For example, HomeGuide says one with a standard tank costs between $600 and $1,800 (CAD 804 and CAD 2,412), while a tankless version can cost between $800 and $3,500 (CAD 1,072 and CAD 4,689).

	The costs for installation depend on the complexity and duration of the job, the location and accessibility of the water heater and the labor rates of the plumber or electrician you hire. The installation costs can also include the costs of removing the old gas water heater, upgrading the electrical panel or wiring and obtaining the necessary permits and inspections. The average installation cost of an electric water heater with a tank can range from $500 to $2,100 (CAD 670 to CAD 2,813). If you opt for the tankless version, expect to pay in the region of $600 to $2,500 (CAD 804 to CAD 3,349).

	The Operating Costs

2024-04-30 18:37:04 Block3_Paragraph 9 MATCHED

	While homeowners naturally budget for the installation costs, it’s equally important to consider the operating costs because, over time, these will have more of an impact on your wallet. The operating costs can depend on the appliance’s energy efficiency and your usage, as well as the electricity rates in your area. Electric water heaters are generally less energy-efficient than gas water heaters, as they use more electricity to heat water. However, they can also have lower maintenance and repair costs, as they have fewer parts and don’t require venting. The average annual operating cost of an electric water heater with a tank can be around $440 and $580 (CAD 590 and CAD 777). For a tankless version, expect to pay around $300 to $535 (CAD 402 to CAD 717).

2024-04-30 18:37:04 Block3_Paragraph 10 MATCHED

	Therefore, the total cost of replacing a gas water heater with an electric water heater can be anywhere between $1,100 and $5,600 (CAD 1,473 and CAD 7,497). The differences are wide because of the cost differences between tank and tankless options. You should also consider other potential savings and benefits of switching, such as:

2024-04-30 18:37:04 Block3_List 11 MATCHED

	Reducing your carbon footprint, especially if your electricity comes from renewable energy sources, such as solar or wind
Increasing your safety by eliminating the risk of gas leaks, explosions and carbon monoxide poisoning
Improving your comfort and convenience by having more control over the temperature and flow of hot water, as well as having more options over the appliance's size and location

	If you're anything like the average American, you probably spend up to 90% of your time inside. With so many people spending hours indoors, the quality of indoor air matters — yet many people never stop to think about what they inhale inside their homes or workplaces. Poor indoor air quality﻿ is also on the rise, with more synthetic ingredients in everyday products increasing exposure to potentially hazardous pollutants.

	Air quality issues can cause various health issues, from headaches to cancer, so monitoring pollutant levels inside your home is important.

2024-04-30 18:40:24 Heading 1: < What Is a Home Air Quality Test? > MATCHED

2024-04-30 18:40:24 Block2_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	Pollutants can enter your home from the outside, potentially compromising indoor air quality. Furthermore, the materials used to construct your home can sometimes release harmful substances into the air you breathe. While you can't do much on an individual level to change the air quality in your local area, there are things you can do to improve air quality inside your home.

2024-04-30 18:40:24 Block2_Paragraph 2 MATCHED

	Improving indoor air quality starts with a home air quality test. Air quality testing involves gathering air samples and checking them for specific toxins. Common toxins found in indoor air samples include:

2024-04-30 18:40:24 Block2_List 3 MATCHED

	Radon
Asbestos
Carbon monoxide
Mold
Formaldehyde
Volatile organic compounds (VOCs)

2024-04-30 18:40:24 Block2_Paragraph 4 MATCHED

	Many homeowners only check their indoor air quality to confirm a known issue. For instance, you may decide to test for asbestos fibers if you recently completed asbestos remediation. However, some people pay for general air quality testing to uncover unknown risks, even if there's no reason to suspect an air quality problem.

	How much a professional home air quality test costs depends on what you're testing for. Professional air testers can perform general whole-house checks to identify areas of concern. These tests can detect most common pollutants, such as VOCs and asbestos. Hiring a pro for an indoor air quality test typically costs around $436 (CAD 587), although prices depend on your home's size and the cost of living in your area.

2024-04-30 18:41:05 Heading 1: < What Is the Process of Switching From a Gas Dryer to an Electric One? > MATCHED

2024-04-30 18:41:05 Block2_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	The first thing you need to do is check if you have an electric hookup in your laundry room. Most electric dryers need a 240-volt outlet, which is different from the standard 120-volt outlets in most homes. If you don't have an electric hookup, you’ll need to hire an electrician to install one for you.

2024-04-30 18:41:05 Block2_Paragraph 2 MATCHED

	The next thing you need to do is disconnect your gas dryer and remove it from your home. You’ll need to turn off the gas valve and unplug the dryer from the wall. Then, detach the gas line and the exhaust vent from the dryer. Finally, you’ll need to seal the gas line. As you’ve probably guessed, these jobs are best left to professionals. You can either sell, donate or recycle your old gas dryer, depending on its condition and age.

2024-04-30 18:41:05 Block2_Paragraph 3 MATCHED

	The final thing you need to do is buy and install your new electric dryer. Choose a model that fits your space, budget and needs. Additionally, you'll need to plug the dryer into the 240-volt outlet and attach the exhaust vent. You can either do this yourself, if you’re confident in your abilities, or hire a professional to do it for you.

	Electric dryer: According to data from Fixr, a new dryer will cost between $500 and $2,100 (CAD 600 and CAD 2,812), depending on the brand, size, features and energy efficiency. You can save money by looking for discounts, rebates or sales or by buying a used or refurbished model.
Outlet installation: HomeGuide says you should expect to pay between $250 and $800 (CAD 335 and CAD 1,071), depending on the electrician's rate, the wiring complexity and the outlet location. You can save money by comparing quotes from different electricians or by doing it yourself if you have the skills and tools. Warning: If you do decide to install the outlet yourself, take all safety precautions to protect yourself and your home.
Gas dryer removal: Budget for around $50 to $100 (CAD 67 to CAD 134), depending on how you dispose of your old gas dryer, according to Forbes. You can save money by selling, donating or recycling your old gas dryer or by hauling it away yourself.
Electric dryer installation: Depending on the installer's rate and the installation difficulty, you can expect to pay in the region of $50 to $200 (CAD 67 to CAD 268). You can save money by installing the dryer yourself or by negotiating a lower price with the installer.

2024-04-30 18:41:06 Block3_Paragraph 3 MATCHED

	The total cost of switching from a gas dryer to an electric one can range from $850 to $3,200 (CAD 1,138 to CAD 4,284). This is a one-time-only expense, and you could recoup some of it in the long run through lower energy bills. Electric dryers are generally cheaper to operate than gas dryers, especially if you have a high-efficiency model that uses less electricity. The exact savings will depend on your electricity and gas rates, your usage frequency and your dryer settings.

	Smart registers are HVAC air vents fitted with a controller that automatically adjusts the volume of air coming into a room from the air conditioning ducting. Each smart vent has a thermostat either fitted to the unit or mounted on the wall that precisely controls the room temperature. Smart vents help optimize home heating and cooling and reduce energy bills. They help eliminate cold rooms in winter and hot rooms in summer.

2024-04-30 18:41:48 Block3_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	Smart air vents control the temperature in a room by automatically adjusting the volume of air coming out of the ducts. If the room is too cold in summer, the vents close to restrict the amount of cool air flowing into the room. If the room is too hot, the vent opens to allow more cool air into the room. They work best when all air vents in a room are converted.

	Static vents with adjustable vanes: These vents have motorized vanes to control airflow. They typically use battery power or a low-voltage AC power adaptor. Their battery life is good. Adjustable vents are best when there's a good flow of warm or cool air through the ducts.
Smart booster fan vents: Register booster fans increase the flow of warm or cool air into the room. They’re effective for adjusting room temperature quickly and are almost exclusively AC-powered.

2024-04-30 18:41:48 Block4_Paragraph 3 MATCHED

	Smart air vents use a thermostat to control the temperature in the room. Some have a built-in thermostat, while others communicate wirelessly to a wall-mounted thermostat. Most are compatible with smart thermostats and standard HVAC thermostats.

2024-04-30 18:44:16 Block2_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	In the pursuit of a healthier, more sustainable lifestyle, the concept of a saltless water softener is gaining prominence. These innovative devices offer a viable alternative to traditional water softeners that rely on salt, presenting a solution that's both eco-friendly and health-conscious.

2024-04-30 18:44:16 Block2_Paragraph 2 MATCHED

	One of the standout advantages of salt-free systems lies in their environmental impact. By eliminating the need for salt regeneration, they reduce the discharge of brine into wastewater, promoting a more sustainable water treatment process. Additionally, these systems appeal to individuals with dietary restrictions, as they don’t introduce excess sodium into the water supply.

2024-04-30 18:44:16 Block3_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	A salt-free water softener works by changing the physical or chemical properties of the hard water minerals. There are different methods for achieving this, including:

2024-04-30 18:44:16 Block3_List 2 MATCHED

	Template-assisted crystallization (TAC): This method uses a special media that acts as a template for the hard water minerals to form tiny crystals that are harmless and easily washed away by water. The media doesn’t need to be replaced or regenerated, and it doesn’t add or remove anything from the water.
Electric or magnetic fields: This method uses electric or magnetic fields to alter the charge or polarity of the hard water minerals so they repel each other and don’t form scale or stick to surfaces. Coils or wires generate electric or magnetic fields that are attached to the water pipes, and they don’t consume much electricity or affect the water quality.
Chelation: This method uses a chemical agent that binds to the hard water minerals and makes them soluble and stable in water. The chemical agent is usually a food-grade citric acid that’s added to the water in small amounts, and it doesn’t affect the taste or health of the water.

2024-04-30 18:44:16 Block3_Paragraph 3 MATCHED

	A salt-free water softener works differently from a salt-based water softener, which uses a process called ion exchange to remove the hard water minerals and replace them with sodium or potassium ions. A salt-free water softener doesn’t remove the hard water minerals; it prevents them from causing problems.

2024-04-30 18:44:16 Block3_Paragraph 4 MATCHED

	Its advantages over a salt-based water softener include:

2024-04-30 18:44:16 Block3_List 5 MATCHED

	No salt or chemicals are required. A salt-free water softener doesn't need salt or chemicals to operate, which saves money and reduces environmental impact.
There’s no water waste. It doesn’t need to regenerate or flush water, which saves water and avoids adding salt or chemicals to the wastewater.
Sodium or potassium aren’t added to the water. It doesn’t add sodium or potassium to water, which may be beneficial for people concerned about their sodium or potassium intake.
There are no corrosion or health risks involved. It doesn’t corrode pipes or appliances or pose any health risks associated with excess sodium or potassium in water.

2024-04-30 18:44:16 Block3_Paragraph 6 MATCHED

	However, there are some limitations:

2024-04-30 18:44:16 Block3_List 7 MATCHED

	It doesn’t necessarily reduce the hardness of the water. It doesn’t reduce the hardness of water, which means the hard minerals are still present and may affect the taste or feel of the water.
It doesn’t remove other contaminants. It doesn’t remove other contaminants that may be present in water, such as iron, manganese, chlorine or bacteria. A separate filter or treatment system may be needed to address these issues.
It’s not universally effective. It may not work well in all water conditions, such as very hard water, very cold water or very high flow rates. You’ll need a proper assessment of your water quality and water usage to determine its suitability and likely performance.

	Your HVAC system probably isn't something you spend a lot of time thinking about ... until it stops working correctly. Homeowners are often quick to notice when something's not quite right. Heating and AC short-cycling is a common issue with a range of causes. Learn what HVAC short-cycling is and why it happens so you can get your system back on track.

2024-04-30 18:44:59 Heading 1: < What Does Short-Cycling Mean in HVAC Terms? > MATCHED

2024-04-30 18:44:59 Block2_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	AC or furnace short-cycling refers to an HVAC system that turns on and off more frequently than it should. It runs for a short time, shuts off for a short period and then turns back on, with each stage of the process happening faster than normal.

2024-04-30 18:44:59 Block2_Paragraph 2 MATCHED

	A system that turns on and off frequently uses more energy than it should and can cause strain on various parts, potentially leading to a system breakdown. That's due to the way the system works. It uses the greatest amount of energy when it first starts up to get the compressor running. When short-cycling happens, it's doing the startup process more frequently. Plus, AC and furnace short-cycling can make your home uncomfortable because the system doesn't run long enough to reach your desired temperature.

2024-04-30 18:44:59 Heading 2: < What Does Short-Cycling Look, Sound and Feel Like? > MATCHED

2024-04-30 18:44:59 Block3_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	You can hear and feel the heating and cooling system turning on and off frequently if it's short-cycling. Pay attention to how long each cycle runs before the equipment shuts off. If it only runs for a few minutes and then stays off for only a few minutes, it's likely short-cycling. A higher utility bill with no obvious reason could be another subtle hint that the system is short-cycling because it uses more power.

2024-04-30 18:44:59 Block3_Paragraph 2 MATCHED

	You might also notice that your home doesn't feel comfortable. It won't likely reach the temperature you have set on the thermostat because it won't run long enough to reach that temperature. Your home might also feel humid, especially in the summer if you have AC short-cycling issues. That's because the system isn't running long enough to remove the excess moisture in the air before it shuts off.

2024-04-30 18:44:59 Heading 3: < What Are Some Common Reasons Heat Pumps, Furnaces and Air Conditioners Short-Cycle? > MATCHED

2024-04-30 18:44:59 Block4_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	Short-cycling AC and furnace issues indicate a problem with the system. Something is causing the system to shut off before it should. Some possible causes of furnace and AC short-cycling include:

2024-04-30 18:44:59 Block4_List 2 MATCHED

	Improper sizing. If your HVAC equipment isn't sized properly for your home, it could cause constant short-cycling. You'll need a new system to stop the short-cycling if this is the cause.
Faulty thermostat. When your thermostat malfunctions, it might tell the system to shut down too soon. This might happen if it reads the temperature incorrectly, for example. Replacing the thermostat typically fixes the issue.
Dirty air filter. If you don't replace or clean your air filter regularly, it could become clogged, which reduces the airflow. It could also cause short-cycling AC problems.
Frozen evaporator coils. The evaporator coils inside the unit can develop ice on them, typically because of a bigger issue such as restricted airflow or a refrigerant leak. This may cause short-cycling AC issues.
Refrigerant leaks. Your air conditioning needs refrigerant to cool your home properly. If the system has a leak, it can cause short-cycling. Refrigerant is dangerous and should only be handled by an HVAC professional.

2024-04-30 18:44:59 Block4_Paragraph 3 MATCHED

	Some of the issues, such as a clogged air filter, are easy to fix yourself. If you notice the issue, check the air filter to see if it's working. Check your thermostat to see if it has low batteries or shows any codes that indicate a problem.

2024-04-30 18:44:59 Block4_Paragraph 4 MATCHED

	Many causes of HVAC short-cycling are best left to professionals. They can accurately diagnose and fix the problem to get your system back on track. Having regular tune-ups done by an HVAC technician can keep the system in good working order and help prevent problems like HVAC short-cycling.

2024-04-30 18:45:47 Block2_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	The answer is yes; you can use a heat pump to heat your home. They’re more efficient than furnaces because they don’t generate heat; instead, they move it from one place to another. They can extract heat from the outdoor air, even when it’s cold, and transfer it to your indoor air. This process requires less energy than burning a fuel, such as natural gas or oil, to create heat.

2024-04-30 18:45:47 Block2_Paragraph 2 MATCHED

	However, not all heat pumps are equal. There are different types, such as air-source, ground-source and water-source, that have different performance and installation characteristics. The most common type is the air-source heat pump, which is similar to a conventional air conditioner but with a reversing valve that allows it to operate in both heating and cooling modes. Air-source heat pumps are relatively easy to install and maintain, but they can lose efficiency in very cold climates, where they may need a backup heating source such as a furnace or an electric heater.

2024-04-30 18:45:47 Block2_Paragraph 3 MATCHED

	Ground-source and water-source heat pumps, also known as geothermal heat pumps, use the earth or a water source to collect heat instead of the outdoor air. These types of pumps are more efficient and reliable than air-source heat pumps because they can tap into a more stable and constant temperature. However, they're also more expensive and complex to install, requiring drilling or digging to access the underground or underwater pipes.

	3. Comfort and Convenience

2024-04-30 18:45:48 Block3_Paragraph 8 MATCHED

	Heat pumps can provide more consistent and even heating and cooling for your home because they can adjust their output to match the demand, rather than cycling on and off like furnaces. This can result in better temperature and humidity control, as well as less noise and wear and tear. Additionally, heat pumps can be more flexible and convenient because they can be controlled by thermostats, timers or smart devices. They can also be integrated with other home systems, such as ventilation, air filtration and dehumidification.

2024-04-30 18:46:28 Block2_Sub Heading 1 MATCHED

	Boiler Systems

2024-04-30 18:46:28 Block2_Paragraph 2 MATCHED

	Boilers heat water, providing either steam or hot water for heating. Steam is distributed via pipes to steam radiators, while hot water can be circulated to baseboard radiators or radiant floor systems. Boilers operate quietly and often provide comfortable, high-quality heat.

2024-04-30 18:46:28 Block2_Sub Heading 3 MATCHED

	To Identify a Boiler:

2024-04-30 18:46:28 Block2_List 4 MATCHED

	Look for a large metal tank or container: Typically located in the basement, this tank heats water or creates steam.
Check for pipes: Unlike furnaces, boilers distribute heat through pipes that lead to radiators or heating panels in rooms.
No ducts: Boilers do not use ductwork to move heat throughout the house.

2024-04-30 18:46:28 Block2_Sub Heading 5 MATCHED

	Furnace Systems

2024-04-30 18:46:28 Block2_Paragraph 6 MATCHED

	Furnaces generate heat by burning fuel (natural gas, propane or oil) or using electricity, and distribute this heat as warm air through a network of ducts. This process is known as forced-air heating because a blower forces the heated air through the ductwork. Furnaces can quickly heat a room and often include filters to clean the air.

2024-04-30 18:46:28 Block2_Sub Heading 7 MATCHED

	To Identify a Furnace:

2024-04-30 18:46:28 Block2_List 8 MATCHED

	Search for a unit that connects to ducts: This is usually a large metal box, often found in the attic, basement, or a dedicated closet.
Look for vents: Warm air is delivered to different rooms through vents in the floor, walls, or ceilings.
Observe the heating process: If you notice air blowing out of vents when the heat is on, you likely have a furnace.

	Hydronic Heat

2024-04-30 18:46:28 Block3_Paragraph 2 MATCHED

	If your home is equipped with either standard or baseboard radiators or has radiant floor heating, it's a clear indicator of having a boiler system. These methods distribute heat more evenly and can be more comfortable than the forced air from a furnace.

2024-04-30 18:46:28 Block3_Sub Heading 3 MATCHED

	Fuel Source and Energy Efficiency

2024-04-30 18:46:28 Block3_Paragraph 4 MATCHED

	The choice between a boiler and a furnace can also depend on the available fuel sources. Natural gas is common for both, but boilers can efficiently operate on oil, electricity or even renewable energy sources. Modern boilers can be highly energy efficient, converting most of the fuel to direct heat, with some high-efficiency models achieving 90% efficiency rates or higher.

2024-04-30 18:46:28 Block3_Sub Heading 5 MATCHED

	Heating Preferences and Home Design

2024-04-30 18:46:28 Block3_Paragraph 6 MATCHED

	Some homeowners prefer boilers due to the type of heat they provide. Boilers tend to deliver a more consistent heat without the drafts associated with forced air systems. The decision might also be influenced by the home’s design. Older homes with existing radiator systems might naturally opt for a boiler, whereas newer constructions might lean towards forced air furnaces for their ability to also support central air conditioning systems.

2024-04-30 18:46:28 Block3_Sub Heading 7 MATCHED

	Regional Climate and Heating Needs

2024-04-30 18:46:28 Block3_Paragraph 8 MATCHED

	In areas with harsh winters, the choice of a heating system can be crucial. Boilers can offer superior warmth and comfort in cold climates due to their efficient heat distribution methods. In contrast, furnaces might be favored in regions with milder winters or where the heating demand is lower, partly because they can easily switch between heating and cooling.

2024-04-30 18:46:28 Heading 3: < Evaluate Your Heating Needs > MATCHED

2024-04-30 18:46:29 Block4_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	Ultimately, whether a boiler or a furnace is best for your home depends on a comprehensive evaluation of your current and future heating needs, your home's layout and insulation, local climate conditions and your personal preferences for comfort and air quality. Consulting with heating professionals can provide valuable insights into the most cost-effective, efficient and comfortable options for your home.

2024-04-30 18:47:12 Block2_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	A return air vent is a critical part of your heating or cooling system. It works by pulling in air from the interior of your home and pushing it back into the HVAC system. Next, this air may go through a filtering system before being heated or cooled and pushed back into your living space.

2024-04-30 18:47:12 Block2_Paragraph 2 MATCHED

	By pulling air out of your living space, the return air vent promotes good air circulation in your home, helping your HVAC run properly. It’s important to note that return air vents are different from supply air vents, which push hot or cool air into your home. Return air vents are typically bigger than supply air vents and they don’t blow air out — they only pull air in.

2024-04-30 18:47:12 Heading 2: < What Can Happen if You Block HVAC Return Air Vents? > MATCHED

2024-04-30 18:47:12 Block3_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	Several things can happen if you block an HVAC vent. First, it can decrease the performance of your heating or cooling unit. This factor, in turn, could make it more difficult, or even impossible, to keep the air in your home at a comfortable temperature.

2024-04-30 18:47:12 Block3_Paragraph 2 MATCHED

	Secondly, it can force your HVAC unit to work harder, which could speed up wear and tear on your unit. This could lead to higher repair bills. Finally, if your HVAC unit isn't operating efficiently and must work harder, it will likely lead to an increase in your energy bills, especially during peak seasons.

2024-04-30 18:47:12 Block4_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	When decorating your home, it’s important to note where your air vents are located. Depending on your heating or cooling system, you may only have one return air vent for your entire home.

2024-04-30 18:47:12 Block4_Paragraph 2 MATCHED

	Unlike supply air vents that often have adjustable slats, return air vents have a metal grill covering. Another way to identify a return air vent is to hold a piece of paper up to it when your HVAC is running. If the paper pulls towards the vent, it’s a return air vent. On the other hand, if it blows away from the vent, it’s a supply air vent.

2024-04-30 18:47:12 Block4_Paragraph 3 MATCHED

	Once you’ve identified your return air vent, make sure nothing is blocking it, such as:

	There are many reasons a home may have a radiator instead of a furnace. Some older homes, particularly in the Midwest and on the East Coast, were originally built with radiators and their, owners never made the switch. Some homeowners prefer radiator heat over forced air because radiators emit more humidity. Forced air furnaces use indoor air and cold outdoor air. When the furnace pulls in the cold air, it can actually reduce the humidity in your home and dry out the indoor air. A homeowner may also opt for a radiator over a furnace because radiators are generally easy to install and maintain. Radiators don't need any ductwork, and they tend to run quietly.

	Radiators are most common in the Pacific Northwest, in the Midwest and along the East Coast, where the seasons change and the winters are cold. In New York, approximately 80% of homes use steam heat or radiator systems, and many older homes in states such as Washington and Minnesota still operate with boiler systems and radiators.

2024-04-30 18:49:36 Block3_Paragraph 2 MATCHED

	Boilers perform well in climates with long winter seasons and temperatures that are known to drop below zero, as they provide consistent, even heat. While furnaces work great in mild to cold climates, they're known to take longer than radiators to fully heat spaces during severely cold weather. Additionally, when you use a traditional furnace with forced air heat, the hot air travels upward. Your room will still warm up, but it can also create cold spots as the heat rises. Hot air from a radiator also rises, but it falls back down to ground level and is reheated once it cools.

2024-04-30 18:49:36 Block4_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	Radiators are connected to boilers or water heaters that create hot water and steam. When the radiator is running, the steam or heat travels through a series of pipes and into the traditional radiator or baseboard radiator. Traditional radiators are designed with vertical tubes that run from the top to the bottom of the unit, while baseboard radiators have horizontal tubes that run horizontally. Both types are connected to the pipes that receive heat from the boiler.

2024-04-30 18:49:36 Block4_Paragraph 2 MATCHED

	The steam or hot water then works to heat up the radiator's coils, and the coils push the hot air out into your space. Traditional radiators are usually installed in the coldest spot of a room, and baseboard heat radiators are generally installed beneath windows and along the baseboards of interior walls. Many larger homes have several radiator units, while a single radiator provides plenty of heat for smaller spaces such as studio apartments.

2024-04-30 18:49:36 Block4_Paragraph 3 MATCHED

	Similar to furnaces, you can adjust and control radiator temperature through a standard thermostat. Upright traditional radiators are also designed with knobs to adjust the heat levels from room to room.

	Passive Systems

2024-04-30 18:50:21 Block3_Paragraph 2 MATCHED

	Passive systems are triggered when water comes into contact with their sensors or detectors. This could involve the activation of moisture-sensitive probes, which, when wet, complete an electrical circuit, signaling the presence of water. The system responds by generating an alarm or initiating an automatic shut-off of the water supply.

2024-04-30 18:50:21 Block3_Sub Heading 3 MATCHED

	Active Systems

2024-04-30 18:50:21 Block3_Paragraph 4 MATCHED

	Active leak detection systems employ a combination of sensors and advanced technology to continuously monitor for water-related anomalies. Moisture sensors detect the slightest hint of water, while acoustic sensors can pick up the sound of leaks within pipes. These systems may also use sophisticated algorithms to analyze patterns and detect irregularities in water flow, signaling the presence of a leak.

	Strategic placement of water leak detectors is crucial to ensure comprehensive coverage. Install detectors in areas prone to water damage, such as basements, near water heaters, washing machine spaces, bathrooms and beneath sinks. Place them near appliances with water connections, like refrigerators and dishwashers. Consider installing detectors near potential sources of leaks, such as plumbing fixtures and pipes. Additionally, situate detectors in spaces where hidden leaks may occur, such as crawl spaces. This thoughtful placement maximizes the effectiveness of leak detection systems, providing early warnings and mitigating potential water-related risks throughout your home or business.

2024-04-30 18:51:03 Block2_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	Before you head to the hardware store, it can be helpful to know what different types of filters are available. Filters come in various materials and types, including:

2024-04-30 18:51:03 Block2_List 2 MATCHED

	Spun glass/fiberglass: These flat filters are affordable but aren't efficient at filtering smaller particles.
Pleated: Another affordable option, these filters use pleats or folds to create more surface area, helping them capture more particles.
Electrostatic: Cotton and paper fibers, along with static electricity, help attract contaminants.
Washable: Some filters are washable and reusable to reduce waste, but they're usually less efficient than disposable versions.
HEPA: The most efficient option, HEPA filters, remove up to 99.97% of particles in the air, but they're more expensive.

2024-04-30 18:51:03 Heading 2: < What Is a MERV Rating? > MATCHED

2024-04-30 18:51:03 Block3_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	MERV, or the minimum efficiency reporting value, assigns a rating to how well a filter removes particles on a scale from 1 to 16. The higher the number, the better a product filters. Understanding MERV ratings can help you figure out what HVAC filter you need.

2024-04-30 18:51:03 Block3_Paragraph 2 NOT MATCHED

	The numbers aren't assigned arbitrarily. They're based on how efficient the filter is at filtering particles of a particular size. For instance, a filter with a MERV rating of 1 to 4 filters particles of 3.0 to 10.0 microns at an efficiency rate of less than 20%. Meanwhile, a filter with a MERV rating of 16 filters particles from 0.30 to 10.0 microns at an efficiency greater than or equal to 95%.

2024-04-30 18:51:03 Block3_Paragraph 3 MATCHED

	It would make sense, then, to always choose a filter with a MERV rating of 16. However, that's not always the best choice. To remove particles that small at that rate, the filter is tightly woven. That means it takes more effort for the system to push air through the filter. If your system can't handle the higher MERV rating, the filter could restrict airflow and make the equipment work harder, which uses more energy and can increase wear on your system. ASHRAE recommends a MERV 13 or higher filter if your system can handle it.

2024-04-30 18:51:04 Block4_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	Getting the correct air filter size is essential for efficient operation. If the filter is too large, it won't fit into the slot in your HVAC system. Buy a filter that's too small and it won't catch all the debris, since it won't cover the entire area.

2024-04-30 18:51:04 Block4_Paragraph 2 MATCHED

	When asking yourself, "What size HVAC filter do I need?" pay attention to length and width as well as thickness. You'll see the size written as "20x25x1" or a similar measurement to show the width, height and thickness in inches.

2024-04-30 18:51:04 Block4_Paragraph 3 MATCHED

	Standard filters are 1 or 2 inches thick, but you can find thicker options that are 3 to 6 inches deep. Not all HVAC systems can handle the thicker filters.

2024-04-30 18:51:04 Block5_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	Start by determining the correct air filter size. Look along the frame of your current air filter for a measurement designation or measure it to determine what size HVAC filter you need. You can also check the manual. Then, consider the MERV rating. If anyone in the home has allergies, a higher MERV rating or a HEPA filter can help remove allergens more effectively.

2024-04-30 18:52:26 Block2_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	Water heater explosions are relatively uncommon, but they can happen — particularly if you don't maintain your unit correctly or ignore common warning signs. Generally, water heater explosions occur when the temperature inside your water heater exceeds the safe limit, increasing the pressure inside the tank and potentially causing it to burst.

2024-04-30 18:52:26 Heading 2: < How Do Water Heater Explosions Happen? > MATCHED

2024-04-30 18:52:26 Block3_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	During a water heater explosion, your unit will likely release significant quantities of scalding water and steam into your home. An explosion can cause serious injuries, such as burns, to anyone near the unit.

2024-04-30 18:52:26 Block3_Paragraph 2 MATCHED

	However, injuries aren't the only potential hazard of a burst water heater. Water released from the tank can cause severe damage to floors, walls and other materials inside your home. The force of the explosion may also damage your belongings.

2024-04-30 18:52:26 Block3_Paragraph 3 MATCHED

	Gas water heater explosions can be particularly dangerous because they may damage the gas line supplying the unit, leading to a gas leak. Gas leaks increase the risk of house fires and can cause physical symptoms such as lightheadedness and nausea.

2024-04-30 18:52:26 Block4_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	The most common cause of a water heater blowing up is rust inside the unit. Rust prevents water and heat from circulating through your system correctly, leading to excessive pressure. Installing your water heater incorrectly can also cause pressure problems and increase the risk of an explosion. Therefore, hiring a professional plumber to install a new water heater is essential.

2024-04-30 18:52:26 Block4_Paragraph 2 MATCHED

	Rust inside your water heater is challenging for a layperson to diagnose, but some common warning signs could indicate a build-up of rust and sediment inside your system. You can reduce the risk of a water heater explosion by scheduling a checkup with a qualified professional whenever you notice one or more of the following issues:

2024-04-30 18:52:27 Block5_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	Water heater explosions are extremely dangerous, so keeping your unit in good working order is essential. Hiring a professional plumber to inspect and clean your water heater at least once yearly can help you spot and fix issues before they become more serious.

2024-04-30 18:52:27 Block5_Paragraph 2 MATCHED

	Running your water heater at the correct temperature can also prevent dangerous pressure from accumulating. Consult your user manual or ask your plumber to determine the optimal temperature for your water heater's make and model. Ensure anyone you hire to install or service your water heater has the correct license to avoid potentially hazardous errors.

2024-04-30 18:52:27 Heading 5: < If the Worst Happens: What to Do If Your Water Heater Explodes > MATCHED

2024-04-30 18:52:27 Block6_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	If your water heater explodes, seek immediate medical attention if anyone sustained burns or scalds. Turning off the water supply can help you avoid costly water damage to your home. If the stopcock is safely accessible, turn the valve clockwise to stop more water from flowing into your unit.

2024-04-30 18:52:27 Block6_Paragraph 2 MATCHED

	Next, turn off the electrical supply to your water heater from the circuit breaker panel. The water released by a burst water heater can cause an electrical fire if it contacts the electrical elements of your unit. If you have a gas-powered water heater, prevent gas from escaping into your home by turning off the emergency shutoff valve.

2024-04-30 18:52:27 Block6_Paragraph 3 MATCHED

	Finally, call an emergency plumber to repair any damage and replace the faulty unit. Avoid approaching the water heater or cleaning up standing water until your contractor tells you it's safe to do so.

2024-04-30 18:52:27 Block6_Paragraph 4 MATCHED

	You can clean smaller leaks by soaking up standing water with old rags or towels and placing fans or dehumidifiers in the affected room to encourage drying. However, you may need to hire a specialized restoration company to repair extensive water damage.

2024-04-30 18:53:09 Block1_Paragraph 3 MATCHED

	If you have a gas dryer and you're thinking about switching to an electric one, here’s everything you need to know.

2024-04-30 18:53:09 Block1_Sub Heading 4 MATCHED

	1. Fewer Utility Bills

2024-04-30 18:53:09 Block1_Paragraph 5 MATCHED

	If you switch to all-electric appliances, you'll eliminate your gas bill altogether, whether that's for natural gas service or propane. However, keep in mind that your electricity bill is likely to be higher than it was before because the appliances that were previously using gas will be using electricity. Of course, cost savings and rate differences depend on where you live and the electrical supplier. For some people, consolidating two bills into one helps simplify monthly budgets.

2024-04-30 18:53:09 Block1_Sub Heading 6 MATCHED

	2. Potential Cost Savings

2024-04-30 18:53:09 Block1_Paragraph7_link 1 MATCHED

	Electric dryers do generally cost less up front|https://www.usnews.com/360-reviews/home-goods/dryers/gas-vs-electric

2024-04-30 18:53:09 Block1_Paragraph 7 MATCHED

	Electric dryers do generally cost less up front, but the difference isn't enormous — only about $100 (CAD 135) or so, depending on where you purchase them from. Electric dryers also generally cost less to repair, and it's possible to repair them yourself with some DIY skills because there isn't a gas line to contend with.

2024-04-30 18:53:09 Block1_Sub Heading 8 MATCHED

	3. Easier Installation

2024-04-30 18:53:09 Block1_Paragraph 9 MATCHED

	At the very least, it's much quicker to install a new electric dryer, especially if you already have a dedicated 240-volt outlet the unit can plug into. If not, you might need to hire an electrician to install more robust wiring and a 240-volt outlet. However, there's also no gas line to hook up with an electric dryer, so that could be a cost advantage.

2024-04-30 18:53:09 Block1_Paragraph 10 MATCHED

	If you don't have an existing gas source, it's probably less expensive to go with an electric dryer. The cost of installing new gas lines and all the safety checks that come with it add up quickly.

	4. Safety Considerations

2024-04-30 18:53:10 Block1_Paragraph 14 MATCHED

	Any time you have gas lines coming into a house, there's the potential for a gas leak, and gas is highly flammable. This is why odor is added to natural gas and propane — so it's easy to smell and detect a leak. Gas appliances, therefore, bring with them the risk of fire. There's also carbon monoxide to consider — carbon monoxide detectors are installed in homes with gas appliances.

2024-04-30 18:53:10 Block1_Paragraph 15 MATCHED

	The risk of an electric dryer, on the other hand, is the same as it would be for any large appliance like your fridge. As long as your wiring is up to date, the potential for a malfunction is fairly low. Make sure the lint trap is clean every time you use it. Don't exceed the dryer's capacity for clothes, and keep surrounding areas free of dust and debris to help minimize risks.

2024-04-30 18:53:10 Block1_Sub Heading 16 MATCHED

	According to Lowe's, because electric dryers are more popular overall, there are generally more models for you to choose from. You may also find there are more colors, finishes and features like wrinkle care and sensor dry to choose from on electric models. More expensive models might include smart home features, which allow you to control their operation from an app on your phone. This could be convenient if your dryer is in a basement or another out-of-the-way place.

2024-04-30 18:53:10 Block1_Paragraph 18 MATCHED

	Whether you opt for an electric or gas dryer depends on your individual situation. While electric dryers cost less up front and are generally less expensive to install, especially if you have an existing 240-volt outlet, gas dryers tend to be more efficient and heat up faster.

2024-04-30 18:53:51 Block2_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	Air filters and water line filters are the two types of filters built into most tankless and traditional water heater models. Air intake filters protect the gas lines from dust, lint and other types of debris, while water line filters prevent sediment from entering the tank or tankless reservoir and forming limescale.

2024-04-30 18:53:51 Block2_Paragraph 2 MATCHED

	When limescale builds up on the interior walls of a water heater, it can hinder operation and damage the heater itself. Heavy sediment that piles up in the bottom of the tank or reservoir can enter your plumbing system and cause cloudy or rust-colored water and reduced water pressure. Limescale on the water heater's interior walls can eventually lead to corrosion, and you may have to replace the entire unit. When maintained and cleaned on a regular basis, water heater filters can help extend the life of your system, improve water quality and ensure your water runs hot when you need it the most.

2024-04-30 18:53:51 Block3_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	The location of your water heater filter (or filters) depends on whether you have a tankless or traditional model. Exact filter locations may also vary based on your water heater's make, model or brand. Here's a rundown of typical water heater filter locations.

2024-04-30 18:53:51 Block3_Paragraph 3 MATCHED

	Water line filters on tankless models ﻿are typically side-mounted between the heater's flush valves or on the center of the unit's exterior. Air intake filters on tankless units are usually found directly beneath the faceplate in a top corner of the unit. The faceplate must be removed to access the air intake filter.

2024-04-30 18:53:51 Block3_Paragraph 5 MATCHED

	On traditional water heaters, sediment/water line filters are usually found near the bottom of the water heater in close proximity to the inlet valve. Air intake filters are also generally located at the bottom of the water heater tank in front of the flame arrestor, a small metal screen that prevents flame ignition.

	If your water heater doesn't already have a water line or air intake filter, it may be a good idea to install one or the other (or both), especially if your home has hard water. Over time, sediment buildup and limescale can cause serious damage to your water heater, resulting in more frequent repairs and a shorter overall life span. Filters help keep unwanted debris out of the tank or tankless unit reservoir, allowing for optimal water heater efficiency. If you're unsure about installing a water heater filter, a licensed plumber can offer professional advice and help determine the best solutions to meet your needs.

2024-04-30 18:54:32 Block2_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	The washing machine pump is responsible for draining the water out of the washing machine tub between cycles. When it breaks, you may notice issues such as:

2024-04-30 18:54:32 Block2_List 2 MATCHED

	Standing water in the tub when the washer has completed a cycle
Water leaking out onto the floor from the bottom of the machine
The washer stopping or starting cycles at odd times, as a broken water pump can cause issues with the water level sensors that control automatic cycles

	If you're not confident about your DIY skills, you may want to hire a professional to handle fixing the water pump for a washer. However, if you hire a professional, you'll pay more for the repair because you'll also need to factor in labor costs. Labor costs can range from $50 to $200 (CAD 67 to 268) and are generally charged by the hour or job. This makes the total average cost to replace a washing machine water pump between $150 and $350 (CAD 201 and CAD 469).

First, you'll need to determine what part you need, which can be done by searching for the make and model online or by contacting the manufacturer. The exact procedure to replace the pump can vary by machine, but in general, you'll need to unplug the washer and take off the face. Then, you can remove the pump and replace it with the new part. Put the face of the washer back on, reconnect the power and run a drain cycle to see if it works properly.

	If you've noticed your heat pump turning on and off more frequently than it should, you might be experiencing a problem known as short-cycling. This issue can affect your comfort, increase your energy bills and potentially damage your HVAC system if left unchecked.

2024-04-30 18:55:16 Heading 1: < What Is Short-Cycling? > MATCHED

2024-04-30 18:55:16 Block2_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	The term short-cycling refers to situations where your heat pump turns on and off more frequently than normal. Instead of completing a full heating or cooling cycle, the system cycles on and off rapidly, sometimes in as little as a few minutes. This behavior can disrupt the comfort of your home and put unnecessary strain on your HVAC system.

2024-04-30 18:55:17 Heading 2: < How Will I Know My Heat Pump Is Short-Cycling? > MATCHED

2024-04-30 18:55:17 Block3_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	Fluctuating temperatures are a sign of short cycling, but they’re not the only sign. The first noticeable symptom is the sound coming from your heat pump. You should hear the fan turn on and then the compressor when your HVAC system is heating or cooling. If you hear the noise changing, it’s often because the compressor is turning off prematurely (HVAC short cycling).

2024-04-30 18:55:17 Heading 3: < Why Is My Heat Pump Short-Cycling? > MATCHED

2024-04-30 18:55:17 Block4_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	Mold and mildew are products of excess moisture, and your dishwasher may hold on to extra water after it finishes cycling. While any remaining moisture should evaporate quickly, small amounts may become trapped in gasket and door seals. Closed dishwashers have zero air circulation, which makes it easy for mold spores to grow.

2024-04-30 18:55:58 Block2_Paragraph 2 MATCHED

	As mold and mildew spores multiply, moldy odors may become more obvious, and you might notice dark specks growing along the inner edges of the dishwasher door. Trapped food particles and clogged dishwasher filters also make great breeding grounds for mold. In some cases, food and dishwasher soap buildup can give the appearance of mold or mildew (including the musty odor).

2024-04-30 18:56:41 Block3_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	These are similar to gas furnaces, except they use propane as their fuel source. Propane is a liquefied petroleum gas that's stored in tanks or cylinders and delivered to homes by trucks. Like gas furnaces, a burner ignites the propane, and a heat exchanger transfers the heat to the air and then into the ducts.

2024-04-30 18:56:41 Block3_Paragraph 2 MATCHED

	Propane furnaces are also rated by their AFUE, which measures how much of the fuel is converted into heat. The efficiency rates are similar to those for natural gas.

	Advantages

2024-04-30 18:56:41 Block3_List 4 MATCHED

	Slightly more efficient than gas furnaces, as propane burns cleaner and hotter and produces more heat per unit of fuel
More versatile, as it can be used in areas where natural gas is not available or accessible
More environmentally friendly than gas furnaces, as propane emits fewer greenhouse gases and pollutants

2024-04-30 18:56:42 Block3_Paragraph 5 MATCHED

	Disadvantages

2024-04-30 18:56:42 Block3_List 6 MATCHED

	More expensive to install and operate, as propane is usually costlier than natural gas and requires additional equipment, such as tanks, regulators and valves
Requires more storage space and safety precautions, as propane tanks can be bulky, heavy and flammable
Depends on the availability and price of propane, which can vary due to supply and demand

2024-04-30 18:56:43 Block5_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	These furnaces use heating oil, a refined petroleum product that’s stored in tanks and delivered to homes by trucks. Oil furnaces have a burner that ignites the oil and a heat exchanger that transfers the heat to the air, which is then blown into rooms by a fan via the ductwork and vents.

2024-04-30 18:56:43 Block5_Paragraph 2 MATCHED

	According to Energy Star, an oil furnace’s AFUE should be 85% or higher. This makes them the least efficient type of furnace.

	Advantages

2024-04-30 18:56:43 Block5_List 4 MATCHED

	More powerful than gas or propane furnaces, as heating oil burns hotter and produces more heat per unit of fuel
Typically more durable, as heating oil doesn’t corrode or damage furnace components as much as gas or propane
More independent than gas or propane furnaces, as heating oil can be stored on-site and used as needed

	Disadvantages

2024-04-30 18:56:43 Block5_List 6 MATCHED

	Costlier to install and operate, as heating oil is usually more expensive than natural gas or propane and requires additional equipment, such as tanks, pumps and filters
Requires more maintenance and inspection, as heating oil can clog, leak or spill, causing fire hazards, environmental issues and health risks
Emits more greenhouse gases and pollutants than gas or propane furnaces, as it produces more carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and particulate matter

2024-04-30 18:57:23 Heading 1: < What Is a Thermostatic Radiator Valve? > MATCHED

2024-04-30 18:57:23 Block2_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	A TRV is a type of radiator valve with a built-in thermostat that senses the air temperature around it. The thermostat controls a valve that opens or closes to adjust the amount of hot water entering the radiator. The device usually has a knob or dial. This allows you to set the desired temperature for the room, helping you save energy and money by reducing the amount of heat that’s wasted in unoccupied rooms and those that don't need to be as warm as others. Homes in colder climates sometimes have TRVs with a frost protection setting to prevent the radiator from freezing in cold weather.

2024-04-30 18:57:23 Block2_Paragraph 2 MATCHED

	A TRV works best with a central heating system with a boiler and a pump that circulates hot water through a network of pipes and radiators. It can be installed on any radiator with a compatible valve connection, which is usually either a 15 mm or a 22 mm pipe. Additionally, a TRV can be fitted on either the flow or the return pipe of the radiator, but it’s normally better to install it on the flow pipe for better performance.

	Even in warmer climates, having some type of heating system is usually necessary to keep your space cozy on chillier days. Here are some options when you're deciding how to add heat to a room:

2024-04-30 18:58:36 Block2_Sub Heading 2 MATCHED

	Ductless Mini-Split Unit

2024-04-30 18:58:36 Block2_Paragraph 3 MATCHED

	This system is similar to a traditional HVAC system because it has an outdoor condenser and an indoor air handler. You can connect multiple air handlers to one condenser if you have a large addition. As a bonus, ductless systems also cool, so you only need one unit for both heating and cooling.

2024-04-30 18:58:36 Block2_Sub Heading 4 MATCHED

	Heat Pump

2024-04-30 18:58:36 Block2_Paragraph 5 MATCHED

	A heat pump moves heat based on where you need it. In the winter, it pulls heat from the outside air and brings it into your home. It also works to cool your home in the summer like a ductless mini-split unit, making it another all-in-one solution.

2024-04-30 18:58:36 Block2_Sub Heading 6 MATCHED

	Packaged Terminal Air Conditioner

2024-04-30 18:58:36 Block2_Paragraph 7 MATCHED

	Never heard of a PTAC? You've likely used one if you've stayed at hotels. They're the wall units you often see in hotel rooms. A PTAC is a self-contained unit that goes through the wall and handles both heating and cooling.

	Baseboard Heaters

2024-04-30 18:58:36 Block2_Paragraph 9 MATCHED

	As the name suggests, this type of heater attaches at the bottom of the wall, where cold air naturally falls. The cold air goes into a vent, and the unit heats the air before blowing it back out. Naturally, the heated air rises, which helps heat the whole room from floor to ceiling.

2024-04-30 18:58:36 Block2_Sub Heading 10 MATCHED

	Wall Heater

2024-04-30 18:58:36 Block2_Paragraph 11 MATCHED

	This option is similar to a baseboard heater, but it uses a heating element and a fan to blow the warm air into the room. Wall heaters typically warm the room faster than baseboard heaters because of the fan.

	Heat Pump

2024-04-30 18:58:37 Block3_Paragraph 5 MATCHED

	You can use a heat pump to keep your addition cool in the summer. In cooling mode, the heat pump pulls the hot air out of your home and moves it outdoors.

	Packaged Terminal Air Conditioner

2024-04-30 18:58:37 Block3_Paragraph 7 MATCHED

	A PTAC can also cool your room in the summer. Simply switch it to cooling mode when it gets warm outdoors.

2024-04-30 18:58:37 Block3_Sub Heading 8 MATCHED

	Window Unit

2024-04-30 18:58:37 Block3_Paragraph 9 MATCHED

	For an affordable option, install a window air conditioner in the room. You can choose units to fit various room sizes for efficient cooling. Wall units are also available — they go through a wall instead of in a window, so you don't lose any window area.

2024-04-30 18:58:37 Block3_Sub Heading 10 MATCHED

	Portable Air Conditioner

2024-04-30 18:58:37 Block3_Paragraph 11 MATCHED

	An alternative to a window air conditioner is a portable air conditioner. It's a freestanding unit that you can move around the space as needed. However, it needs to be vented outdoors to create an exhaust option for heat and moisture. Most models include window kits that allow you to vent the house out a window.

	It's possible to run ductwork from your existing central heating and cooling system to your addition or sunroom, but it's not always feasible. When an HVAC unit is installed, it's sized for the home's square footage and features. Your system might keep up with your home comfort needs now, but extending it to the new space might stretch it too thin. Putting that much strain on the system can cause it to wear out sooner and leave you feeling cooler or warmer than you want.

2024-04-30 18:58:37 Block4_Paragraph 2 MATCHED

	If you want one system for everything, consult with an HVAC pro. They can tell you if your existing system can handle the extra load. If you're ready to replace your old system anyway, you could install a new, larger system to cover the entire house. An HVAC company can evaluate the situation and recommend the most effective options for your addition.

2024-04-30 19:01:07 Block2_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	In comparison with other large appliances in your home, the dryer’s mechanism is relatively simple. Therefore, fewer things can go wrong. However, when something does, it can be as frustrating as when any other appliance fails. Let’s look at the top three likely dryer repair parts.

2024-04-30 19:01:07 Block2_Sub Heading 2 MATCHED

	1. The Door Switch

2024-04-30 19:01:07 Block2_Paragraph 3 MATCHED

	The door switch is an unassuming part of the appliance, yet it’s vital to a successful drying cycle. A door that doesn't close fully means a dryer that won’t start. In an electric dryer, the switch completes the circuit, allowing the heating element to engage and start the drying process. In a gas dryer, it’s a safety mechanism that prevents the release of gas, ensuring the burner can only ignite when the door is closed. Consequently, when the door switch fails, your dryer won't work.

2024-04-30 19:01:07 Block2_Paragraph 4 MATCHED

	The most common causes of door switch faults are:

2024-04-30 19:01:07 Block2_List 5 MATCHED

	A faulty connection
Continuous opening and closing of the dryer door, causing the contact within the switch to wear down
Misalignment of the switch or latch

	2. Blown Thermal Fuse

2024-04-30 19:01:08 Block2_Paragraph 13 MATCHED

	The thermal fuse is situated in the heating element circuit. Its purpose is to interrupt the power supply if the dryer's temperature becomes excessively high. A blown thermal fuse disrupts the heat source, leaving your dryer unable to generate warmth. The result is prolonged drying times, ineffective cleaning and damp laundry. It’s also a potential safety risk, so you shouldn’t use the dryer if this fault occurs.

2024-04-30 19:01:08 Block2_Paragraph 14 MATCHED

	The most common causes of thermal fuse faults are:

2024-04-30 19:01:09 Block2_List 15 MATCHED

	Inadequate ventilation, which allows hot air to accumulate inside, triggering the fuse’s safety mechanism to prevent a potential fire
A faulty cycling thermostat failing to regulate the dryer’s temperature, resulting in overheating and triggering the fuse’s safety feature
A blockage in the dryer’s airflow path, such as lint in the exhaust vent or duct, generating excessive heat and blowing the fuse

	3. Gas Valve Coils

2024-04-30 19:01:09 Block2_Paragraph 21 MATCHED

	Gas valve coils regulate the release of gas needed for heating. When the dryer initiates a drying cycle, the gas coils receive an electrical signal, opening them to permit the flow of gas to the burner. Conversely, when the cycle concludes, the coils close, cutting off the gas supply. If they fail, the flow of gas to the burner is either erratic or nonexistent. The result is no heat or not enough to dry the clothes. Addressing faulty gas coils promptly is essential for restoring the dryer's functionality and preventing potential safety hazards.

2024-04-30 19:01:47 Block2_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	The belt on your washing machine is what allows the drum to spin and rotate during the wash cycles. The belt connects to the motor and the drum and uses the power from the motor to make the drum spin. When the belt breaks, there's a disconnect.

2024-04-30 19:01:47 Block2_Paragraph 2 MATCHED

	A belt can break suddenly, but it's more common for it to fray over time and then break. Signs of a problem with your washing machine belt include a smell of burnt rubber, squealing or thumping sounds and issues with your wash cycle. For example, you may notice that the machine stops mid-cycle or won't agitate. If your washer provides an error code, you can look it up to see if it indicates an issue with the belt.

2024-04-30 19:01:48 Block4_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	Washing machine belt repair is a quick and fairly easy job if you have the right tools and some general mechanical knowledge. Before attempting to fix the machine yourself, make sure the repair isn't covered under your warranty. If you still have an active warranty, making any DIY repairs can void it, so double-check your paperwork before getting started.

2024-04-30 19:01:48 Block4_Paragraph 2 MATCHED

	Start by disconnecting the power and water supply lines from the washing machine and pulling it out from the wall. The access panel for the belt is likely to be in the back of the machine, but some models have it in the front. Remove the panel and find the belt. This is also a good time to see if an item, such as a hair clip or sock, got stuck and broke the belt.

2024-04-30 19:01:48 Block4_Paragraph 3 MATCHED

	Pull the old belt off and attach the new one. The belt is designed for a perfect fit, and you'll need to stretch it gently to get it in place. It's important to make sure the belt is straight and centered on the pulleys to avoid fraying and another break down the line. Manually spin the washer drum to ensure everything is connected properly, and put the washer back together. Reattach the hoses and power supply, and run a cycle without clothes to test it.

2024-04-30 19:02:26 Block1_Paragraph 3 MATCHED

	Could your boiler possibly damage your property, or even risk your health and that of your loved ones? Is a boiler explosion even possible?

2024-04-30 19:02:26 Heading 1: < Can a Boiler Explode? > MATCHED

2024-04-30 19:02:26 Block2_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	The answer is yes, it can. Boiler explosions are rare, but they can be dangerous and costly and cause serious injuries, property damage and death.

2024-04-30 19:02:26 Heading 2: < Top 5 Causes of Boiler Explosions > MATCHED

2024-04-30 19:02:26 Block3_Sub Heading 1 MATCHED

	1. Excessive Pressure

2024-04-30 19:02:26 Block3_Paragraph 2 MATCHED

	One of the main causes of boiler explosions is excessive pressure. This can happen when the pressure relief valve fails to release the excess steam or water that builds up inside the boiler. The PRV is a safety device that regulates the pressure level and prevents it from going beyond a certain limit. If it’s faulty, blocked or set incorrectly, the pressure can rise uncontrollably, causing the boiler to rupture or explode.

2024-04-30 19:02:26 Block3_Paragraph 3 MATCHED

	To avoid this, you should check the PRV regularly and make sure it’s working properly. Monitor the pressure gauge on your boiler and keep it within the recommended range. If you notice any signs of high pressure, such as hissing noises, leaks or dripping water, turn off the boiler and call a professional plumber immediately.

2024-04-30 19:02:26 Block3_Sub Heading 4 MATCHED

	2. Gas Leaks

2024-04-30 19:02:26 Block3_Paragraph 5 MATCHED

	Gas leaks can occur when gas pipes or fittings are damaged, corroded or poorly installed. They can create a highly flammable and explosive atmosphere around the boiler, especially if there’s a source of ignition nearby, such as a spark, a flame or an electrical appliance. Gas leaks can also pose a serious health risk, as they can cause carbon monoxide poisoning, which can be fatal.

2024-04-30 19:02:26 Block3_Paragraph 6 MATCHED

	To prevent gas leaks, have a qualified gas engineer service your boiler annually. Inspect the gas pipes and fittings regularly and look for any signs of damage, corrosion or wear and tear. If you smell gas or suspect a leak, turn off the gas supply, open the windows, evacuate the premises and call the emergency gas service as soon as possible.

2024-04-30 19:02:26 Block3_Sub Heading 7 MATCHED

	3. Water Supply Issues

2024-04-30 19:02:26 Block3_Paragraph 8 MATCHED

	A third reason for boiler explosions is water supply issues. These can occur when the water level in the boiler drops too low, or the water flow is interrupted or restricted. There are various reasons for these issues, such as leaks, blockages, frozen pipes, faulty pumps and faulty sensors. When the water supply is insufficient, the boiler can overheat and produce steam at a very high temperature and pressure. This can cause the boiler to melt, crack or explode.

2024-04-30 19:02:26 Block3_Paragraph 9 MATCHED

	To prevent water supply issues, check the water level in your boiler regularly and make sure it’s adequate. Check the water pipes and valves for any leaks, blockages or damage. If you notice any problems with the water supply, turn off the boiler and call a professional plumber as soon as you can.

2024-04-30 19:02:26 Block3_Sub Heading 15 MATCHED

	5. Age and Wear and Tear

2024-04-30 19:02:26 Block3_Paragraph 16 MATCHED

	Boilers have a limited life span, and they tend to deteriorate over time. As they age, they become less efficient, less reliable and more prone to faults and failures. They also become more susceptible to external factors, such as weather, temperature, humidity and vibration. These can cause the boiler to weaken, crack or leak, increasing the chances of an explosion.

2024-04-30 19:02:26 Block3_Paragraph 17 MATCHED

	To prevent age and wear and tear issues, replace your boiler when it reaches the end of its useful life. The average life span of a boiler is around 10 to 15 years, depending on the type, model and usage. If your boiler is nearing the end of its life, consider upgrading your boiler to a newer and more efficient one, as this can save you money on energy bills, reduce your carbon footprint and improve your comfort and safety.

	Understanding AFUE ratings can empower you to make informed choices about your heating system. Consequently, you can keep your home warm while also managing your financial and environmental well-being.

2024-04-30 19:13:10 Heading 1: < What Is an AFUE Rating? > MATCHED

2024-04-30 19:13:10 Block2_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	AFUE is a rating system that measures the efficiency of gas-fired and electric heating systems, such as furnaces and boilers. Imagine your furnace as a machine converting fuel, such as oil or propane, into heat. The AFUE rating reflects how effectively this conversion happens over a year.

2024-04-30 19:13:10 Heading 2: < How Is AFUE Measured? > MATCHED

2024-04-30 19:13:10 Block3_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	AFUE is measured by dividing the system's heat output by the total fuel energy consumed. Essentially, it measures how much of the fuel's energy translates into usable heat for your home. While a higher AFUE indicates better efficiency, factors such as maintenance, insulation and ductwork also influence overall performance. So, if you’re considering heating options, understanding AFUE can help gauge your long-term energy costs and environmental impact.

	Before we answer that question, let’s take a look at the different AFUE ranges to understand the differences between low- and high-efficiency boilers and furnaces.

2024-04-30 19:13:10 Block4_List 2 NOT MATCHED

	Low-efficiency: These appliances, while meeting minimum standards, are considered outdated and wasteful. They convert less than 70% of fuel into heat, leading to higher energy bills and carbon emissions. If your furnace or boiler is in this range, you should seriously consider replacing it.
Mid-efficiency: This category represents a significant improvement, with appliances utilizing 80%-83% of fuel for heating. This translates to cost savings and reduced environmental impact compared to low-efficiency models. Long term, much of the cost of installing a boiler or furnace with this rating can be offset by lower energy bills.
High-efficiency: Appliances with these ratings are considered the champions of efficiency. They convert 90% or more of fuel into heat, resulting in substantial savings on your energy bills and minimizing your carbon footprint. They often come equipped with advanced technologies, such as condensing heat exchangers, that further maximize their efficiency.

2024-04-30 19:13:10 Block4_Paragraph 3 MATCHED

	So, what constitutes a "good" AFUE rating? Unfortunately, there's no one-size-fits-all answer. It depends on various factors, such as:

2024-04-30 19:13:10 Block4_List4_link 1 MATCHED

	$2,000 and $5,200|https://homeguide.com/costs/gas-furnace-prices

2024-04-30 19:13:10 Block4_List 4 MATCHED

	Your climate. If you live in a region with harsh winters and prolonged heating needs, a high-efficiency furnace (90%+) could significantly reduce your energy bills over time. However, in milder climates, a mid-efficiency model (80%-90%) might offer an adequate balance between cost and efficiency. You should expect to pay between $2,000 and $5,200 (CAD 2,694 and CAD 7,004) for a mid-efficiency model.
Your budget. High-efficiency furnaces generally have a higher up-front cost. For example, a gas furnace installation will cost between $3,300 and $6,900 (CAD 4,445 and CAD 9,294). While they deliver long-term savings, the initial investment might not be feasible for everyone. Consider the payback period — how long it takes for the energy savings to offset the higher initial cost.
Environmental impact. If minimizing your carbon footprint is a priority, a high-efficiency furnace is the clear winner. Its lower fuel consumption translates to reduced greenhouse gas emissions.

2024-04-30 19:13:10 Block5_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	Look for the Energy Guide label affixed to the unit itself. This label will feature a bright yellow rectangular sticker displaying the product's AFUE (Annual Fuel Utilization Efficiency) rating. It’s often accompanied by an estimated annual energy consumption figure, comparisons to similar models and additional information, such as the manufacturer's name and model number. This helps consumers make informed decisions by providing key details about the appliance's energy efficiency and potential cost savings over time. If the label is missing, consult your owner's manual or contact the manufacturer.

2024-04-30 19:13:10 Block5_Paragraph 2 MATCHED

	Remember, AFUE isn’t the only factor influencing your heating system's performance and cost-effectiveness. Regular maintenance, proper sizing for your home and the quality of your home’s insulation all play crucial roles. Consulting a qualified HVAC professional can help you make an informed decision based on your specific needs and circumstances.
