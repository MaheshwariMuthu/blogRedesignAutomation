	Windows are one of the things many people consider when choosing a home. Are there enough windows? Are they properly placed to catch the morning or afternoon sun? Do they add visual appeal to the exterior and interior space? And as important as windows are, often the first thing we do when moving into a space is cover them up.

Heading 2: < Types of Window Treatments > MATCHED

Block3_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	How much window blinds, shades or curtains cost depends on a variety of factors, including the size of your windows, the material and where you buy them. Here's a look at some average price ranges for different types of shades, drapes and blinds:

Block3_Sub Heading 2 MATCHED

	How Much Do Curtains Cost?

Block3_Paragraph 3 MATCHED

	Prices for curtains can range from $7 to $20 (CAD 9 to CAD 26) per panel for basic curtains, up to between $250 and $1,500 (CAD 330 and CAD 2,000) or more for custom or designer panels.

Block3_Paragraph 4 MATCHED

	So what’s the average cost? Inexpensive fabrics in basic designs from retailers such as Walmart, Target, Big Lots or Amazon cost $15 to $40 (CAD 20 to CAD 50) per panel or panel pair. You can buy curtains one panel at a time or in sets to cover a window.

Block3_Paragraph 5 MATCHED

	More expensive fabrics, which can include linen or silk, may cost $20 to $150 (CAD 26 to CAD 200) per panel or more. Lined curtains meant to support energy efficiency, such as thermal or blackout curtains, often cost about the same price.

Block3_Paragraph 6 MATCHED

	Typically, the bigger your windows and the more area you want to cover with curtains, the higher the price.

Block3_Paragraph 7 MATCHED

	If you're installing curtains, you may also have to buy curtain rods and installation hardware. Other expenses could include valances, cornices, finials and other decorative items, depending on how you want the windows to look when you're done. These additional items can add between $5 and $600 (CAD 6 and CAD 790) or more, depending on how elaborate you want to get.

Block3_Sub Heading 8 MATCHED

	How Much Do Blinds Cost?

Block3_Paragraph 9 MATCHED

	The cost of blinds depends on what type of blinds you purchase and how big your windows are. PVC or fabric blinds tend to cost less than wood slats, for example.

Block3_Paragraph10_link 1 MATCHED

	Bob Vila|https://www.bobvila.com/articles/how-much-do-blinds-cost/

Block3_Paragraph 10 MATCHED

	Slat blinds, which are also often called mini blinds, cost $6 to $90 (CAD 8 to CAD 120) per window, depending on size and material, according to Bob Vila. Vertical blinds, or Roman blinds, start around $30 (CAD 40) per window. Roller blinds, which are usually a long piece of fabric or woven pieces that unroll to cover the window, can cost $8 to $190 (CAD 10 to CAD 250) per window.

Block3_Paragraph 11 MATCHED

	As with curtains, if you want specialty, designer or custom blinds, you will likely pay much more. Most store-bought blinds do come with the basic hardware you'll need to hang them, so you don't typically have to worry about a lot of extra costs there.

Block3_Sub Heading 12 MATCHED

	How Much Do Shades Cost?

Block3_Paragraph 14 MATCHED

	You may need to purchase hardware or other materials to install shades, depending on what type you invest in. That extra cost ranges between $5 and $40 (CAD 6 and CAD 50) per window.

Heading 3: < How Much Does Installation Cost? > MATCHED

Block4_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	If you're opting for discount blinds and shades or other affordable window coverings, you'll probably just install them yourself. Custom curtains, blinds and shades may call for professional installation — especially if you want them to look and function their best. These types of jobs might even call for extra steps, such as removing screens or adding molding to windows.

	HomeGuide|https://homeguide.com/costs/handyman-prices

Block4_Paragraph 2 MATCHED

	Installation costs vary depending on where you live and who you hire. According to data from HomeGuide, a handyman may charge $50 to $80 (CAD 65 to CAD 100) per hour.

Heading 4: < Factors That Impact Window Treatment Cost > MATCHED

Block5_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	The type of window covering you choose — from basic fabric blinds to designer drapes — impacts the overall cost. Here are some other factors that can affect how much you pay for window treatments:

Block5_Sub Heading 2 MATCHED

	Size

Block5_Paragraph 3 MATCHED

	The larger the area to cover, the more material you need. And that means more expensive window coverings. Some people choose curtains that are designed only to cover part of a window to help cut down on costs while also creating a decorative look. It’s also cheaper to cover standard-size windows because some treatments come precut. If you have custom windows, you may need custom coverings.

Block5_Sub Heading 4 MATCHED

	Material

Block5_Paragraph 5 MATCHED

	Custom and luxury materials and fabrics will cost more. Thicker curtain fabric or curtains with more layers also cost more. That's why sheers — curtains made of very thin material you can see through — are often the least expensive option.

Block5_Sub Heading 6 MATCHED

	Decorative Elements

Block5_Paragraph 7 MATCHED

	A curtain rod can cost a couple of dollars on the low end, and installation hardware for blinds is often free and comes in the box. But if you want something more, you may end up paying a lot for it. Decorative finials, specialty coverings to create seamless visuals with blinds or tie-back hooks can all increase the cost of installation.

Block5_Sub Heading 8 MATCHED

	Specialty Care

Block5_Paragraph 9 MATCHED

	Most window coverings are fairly easy to care for. However, if you purchase custom window treatments, you may want to pay someone to clean or maintain them occasionally or invest in specialty equipment, such as a steam-cleaning system, to do it yourself properly. This can help lengthen the life of the window treatments to protect your investment.

Heading 5: < Reasons to Invest in Window Coverings > MATCHED

Block6_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	Window coverings can be a pricey addition to your home decor. Even if you opt for affordable window coverings, the cost adds up based on how many windows you have. Here are some of the reasons people consider window covers to be a wise investment:

Block6_Sub Heading 2 MATCHED

	Privacy

Block6_Paragraph 3 MATCHED

	Depending on where you live, people might be able to peek into your home through your windows. Drawing the curtains or pulling down the shades is an easy way to keep your business to yourself.

Block6_Sub Heading 4 MATCHED

	The Look

Block6_Paragraph 5 MATCHED

	Curtains and other window coverings are a great way to add color and visual appeal to your rooms.

Block6_Sub Heading 6 MATCHED

	Energy Efficiency

Block6_Paragraph 7 MATCHED

	Window coverings block sunlight during warm months to help keep the interior of your home cool. During the cooler months, they can keep cold air out and help block drafts. Thermal or energy-efficient curtains and blinds help with this even more and might even contribute to reducing your utility bills. That potential savings could help make up for some of the investment.

Heading 6: < How Often Do You Need to Replace Window Coverings? > MATCHED

Block7_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	Quality curtains, blinds or other window treatments can last for years, especially when they're installed correctly and maintained well. That's another reason to invest in window treatments that you really like; you may also want to consider neutral curtains or blinds that will work with future changes you make to the room's decor.

Block7_Paragraph 2 MATCHED

	Make sure to follow the manufacturer's instructions when using blinds or shades to keep from breaking them. Use dusting or cleaning tools to keep them clean. Curtains are often a bit easier to maintain, as you can take them down for washing, steaming or dry cleaning as needed. Deep clean window coverings at least twice a year to cut down on dust and other issues that can collect in these areas.
