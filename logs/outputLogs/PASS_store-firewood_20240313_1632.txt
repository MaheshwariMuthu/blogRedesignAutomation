Block1_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	When the chill of winter settles in, there's nothing quite like the warmth and comfort of a crackling fire. But that cozy blaze begins long before the hearth with the proper storage of your firewood. One of the main benefits of storing your firewood correctly is that it aids in the drying or "seasoning" process of the wood.

Block1_Paragraph 3 MATCHED

	Seasoned wood has a much lower moisture content compared to freshly cut, “green” wood. This means it burns hotter and more efficiently, giving you more heat output for the same amount of wood. Seasoned wood also produces less creosote, which is a flammable substance that can accumulate in your chimney and can cause a chimney fire if not regularly cleaned. To top it all off, proper firewood storage will prevent problems like rot, infestations and unnecessary waste from affecting your firewood pile.

Block1_Paragraph 4 MATCHED

	So, whether you're a seasoned wood burner or a green one, you’ll want to learn the six essential steps of effective firewood storage.

Heading 1: < Store Your Firewood Outside > MATCHED

Block2_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	Firewood can house and attract a variety of pests like termites, beetles and rodents. By storing your firewood outside, you minimize the risk of introducing these pests into your home.

Block2_Paragraph 2 MATCHED

	When selecting an outdoor location, find a spot with plenty of sunlight and wind — two natural elements that are key to the seasoning process. The sun's heat helps to dry out the wood, and the wind carries away the moisture, both of which effectively speed up the drying time.

Heading 2: < Store Your Firewood Away From Your Home > MATCHED

Block3_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	Just because your firewood pile is stored outside, the pests it’s likely to inhabit may still make their way into your home if the pile is stored too close. In addition, firewood (especially when it’s dry) is combustible and can put your home at risk if a fire breaks out in your woodpile that’s located close by.

Block3_Paragraph 2 MATCHED

	However, you don’t want the pile so far away that it’s inconvenient to fetch in cold weather, so the ideal distance is a balance between convenience and safety. As a general rule, it’s best to stack store your firewood 20 to 30 feet away from your home.

Heading 3: < Elevate Your Firewood > MATCHED

Block4_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	Elevating your firewood off the ground is an important step in reducing moisture absorption. You can achieve this by stacking your firewood on pallets, a specially designed firewood rack or pressure-treated lumber. Doing so creates a barrier between your wood and the ground, preventing moisture seepage and decay from ruining your firewood.

Heading 4: < Properly Stack Your Firewood > MATCHED

Block5_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	Properly stacking your firewood will help to promote proper airflow to speed up the drying time and deter pests while minimizing moisture exposure. There are a number of common and effective stacking methods to choose from.

Block5_Sub Heading 2 MATCHED

	Traditional Stacking Method

Block5_Paragraph 3 MATCHED

	The traditional wood stacking method involves placing split logs horizontally in rows, one on top of another and usually in a straight line. The base layer of logs is laid side by side, and each subsequent layer is stacked perpendicular to the previous one. This pattern creates a stable, well-ventilated stack. The main downside of this method is that it tends to be time-consuming and labor-intensive to set up. It may also require a considerable amount of storage space depending on the amount of wood you need to stack, making it less suitable for smaller storage areas.

Block5_Sub Heading 4 MATCHED

	Crisscross Stacking

Block5_Paragraph 5 MATCHED

	Also known as log cabin stacking, this method involves laying down two logs parallel to each other, then adding two more logs on top perpendicular to the first layer to create a square. This pattern is repeated until the stack reaches a suitable height. This method promotes greater airflow than the traditional stacking method, but can be more time-consuming and labor-intensive to set up. And like the traditional stacking method, crisscross stacking often requires a large amount of space, so it may not be ideal for smaller storage areas.

Block5_Sub Heading 6 MATCHED

	Vertical Stacking

Block5_Paragraph 7 MATCHED

	Also known as pillar stacking, the firewood is stacked vertically with the cut ends facing up and down. The key advantage of this method is that it allows water to run off more easily due to the vertical orientation of the wood. This can make the drying or seasoning process more efficient, particularly in wetter climates. The vertical stacking method also takes up less horizontal space than traditional or crisscross stacking methods, which can be beneficial in smaller areas. The main disadvantage of vertical stacking is that it tends to be less stable than other methods. The stack can be more susceptible to toppling, especially as the height increases. This lack of stability can create a safety risk, particularly in areas that are prone to wind or where children and pets may be present.

Block5_Sub Heading 8 MATCHED

	Holz Hausen Method

Block5_Paragraph 9 MATCHED

	Originating from Germany, this method involves stacking firewood in a circular pattern. The logs are placed radially in a circular shape, with the bark facing outwards to shed water. The conical shape allows for optimized airflow and faster drying compared to the traditional or crisscross stacking method. The compact design also means that it takes up less space, making it a more practical solution for smaller areas. The primary disadvantage is that it’s the most time-consuming and labor-intensive to set up, and requires a greater adherence to proper technique in order to balance the distribution of wood sizes to ensure stability.

Block5_Sub Heading 10 MATCHED

	Rack Stacking

Block5_Paragraph 11 MATCHED

	This method involves using a firewood rack to stack the wood. These racks keep the firewood off the ground, and they make stacking firewood quick and easy. The main drawback is that they can be an additional expense if you don’t already have one, and large models can be fairly expensive if you need to stack a large quantity of wood.

Heading 5: < Keep Your Firewood Covered > MATCHED

Block6_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	Covering your firewood pile will help protect it from the rain and snow, which can dampen the wood and contribute to rot.

Block6_Paragraph 2 MATCHED

	One common way to cover a firewood pile is by using a tarp. A tarp is generally inexpensive, easy to find and simple to use. You can place the tarp over the top of the pile and secure it with weights or ropes. However, aim to only cover the top third of the pile while leaving the sides exposed. Covering the sides of the woodpile can trap moisture and restrict airflow, which can hinder the seasoning process.

Block6_Paragraph 3 MATCHED

	If you’re using a firewood rack and want a more tailored fit, you might consider purchasing a specially designed firewood cover. These are often made to fit specific sizes of firewood racks and can include features like ventilation ports, tie-downs and easy-access openings.

Block6_Paragraph 4 MATCHED

	For a more permanent solution, a firewood storage shed or lean-to can be an excellent option. These structures typically have a solid roof to protect the wood from the elements and open sides for airflow. Though a shed requires more space and investment, it can be a convenient and aesthetically pleasing solution.

Heading 6: < Rotate Your Firewood Stock > MATCHED

Block7_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	Using your oldest wood first (often referred to as "first in, first out") ensures that no wood sits around long enough to rot or become infested. To effectively manage this rotation, consider stacking your newest wood at the back of your storage area or on the bottom if you're stacking vertically.
