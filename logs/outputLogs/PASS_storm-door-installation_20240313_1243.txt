Heading 3: < Can the Glass in a Storm Door Be Replaced? > MATCHED

Block4_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	The glass in a storm door is typically made of tempered glass, which doesn’t break or crack easily. It's significantly stronger than standard glass. If it does break, it tends to crumble into circular-shaped pebbles instead of sharp pieces.

Block4_Paragraph 2 MATCHED

	Low-emissivity glass is another option for storm doors, but it costs more. According to Family Handyman, Low-E glass is tempered and comes with extra UV protection. This type of glass minimizes the amount of UV light that comes through the door, potentially keeping your indoor space cooler.

Block4_Paragraph 3 MATCHED

	Over time, the glass in your storm door may need to be replaced — either due to a break or just general wear and tear. It’s usually an easy, inexpensive fix that you may even be able to do yourself.

Block4_Paragraph 4 MATCHED

	According to Fixr, the cost to replace glass in a storm door can range from $125 to $290 (CAD 160 to CAD 370), depending on the size and whether it’s a full- or partial-view glass panel.

Block4_Paragraph 5 MATCHED

	Depending on the reason for the replacement, you may be better off replacing the entire door instead of just the glass. A professional contractor can help you make a decision based on the damage.
