	How you repair your doorframe will depend largely on what’s wrong with it, so start any repair by assessing the damage. Common problems, such as a split or warped frame or cosmetic damage, can be fixed. If your frame's suffered a lot of damage, it may be easier to replace the whole frame instead of repairing it.

	Remove the door: Use a power drill or screwdriver to remove the hinges from the door jamb. Have your helper hold the door for you to avoid injury. Move the door out of the way.

	How Do You Repair a Warped Doorframe?

Block4_Paragraph 10 MATCHED

	Doorframes can warp over time, but you may be able to bring it back to level.

Block4_List 11 MATCHED

	Remove the shims: Remove the molding, but not the door. Then, remove the shims. These small, wooden wedges are used to keep the doorframe plumb.
Level the frame: Use a mallet to gently hammer the frame to level it out. A piece of wood held over the frame can help protect it from damage.
Measure as you go: Measure the frame as you work to make sure it stays even on both sides and the top and bottom. Warped wood may be a result of water damage, so check for mold or rot while you have the molding off.
Reinstall shims and molding: Install new shims on both sides of the jamb at the hinge height of the door. Open and close the door as you’re installing them to ensure it’s even. Nail the shims in place, then reinstall the molding.

Fill gap: Use folded wire mesh to fill in the gap in the wood.

	Determine the problem: Hold your level against each side of the frame to determine where adjustment is needed.
Insert shims: Gently tap wooden shims between the jamb and doorframe until it’s level. Start on the hinge side and measure as you go to see if the frame is plumb. Continue adding shims around the frame at intervals until it’s completely level.
Nail in place: Hammer nails into the door jamb through both the frame and shims.
Tidy up the shims: Saw off any protruding portions of the shims to ensure they’re flush with the wall.
Finish repair: Replace the original casing and molding and remount the door.
