	The price of a Samsung smart washer or dryer includes the unit itself and shipping costs. You can also return your appliance free of charge within 15 days of purchase.

	However, the price doesn't cover installation. Samsung can install your appliance for you for a flat fee of $24.96 (CAD 33). Bear in mind that you may also need to hire a plumber or an electrician if you don't have the correct setup to support your new washer or dryer, so it's worth checking the installation checklist before buying. The company charges an additional $15 (CAD 20) to remove and dispose of your existing washer or dryer.

Block5_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	Smart washers and dryers can connect to your home’s Wi-Fi. This function lets you control the appliance remotely from your smartphone or another handheld device using an app. The primary advantage of a smart washer or dryer is that you can start or stop cycles when you're away from your home and receive updates when the cycle finishes. Many smart appliances come with extra features — such as remote troubleshooting — depending on which brand and model you purchase.

Block5_Paragraph 2 MATCHED

	You can control your Samsung smart washer or dryer using the manufacturer’s Smart Care app. This app helps you remotely schedule cycles and start and stop the machine, and it provides cycle suggestions for the best settings for your laundry load. If your machine malfunctions, you can perform diagnostic tests from the app and access troubleshooting solutions to help you get your appliance up and running again.
