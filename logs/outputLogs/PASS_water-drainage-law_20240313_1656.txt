	Finding water runoff from a neighbor’s yard can be a frustrating and awkward dilemma for any homeowner. Not only can excess water wreak havoc on your yard, but it can also lead to other water-related issues if the water collects in or near your home. Water collecting near your house can lead to flooding, causing mold and mildew growth, wood rot and even cracked foundations. It’s not pretty.

Block1_Paragraph 5 MATCHED

	You might be wondering what you can do if a neighbor’s water runoff is draining onto your property. For example, whose legal responsibility is it to fix the problem? The answer? It depends.

Heading 1: < Common Enemy Rule Vs. Civil Law Rule > MATCHED

Block2_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	Unfortunately, in the vast majority of cases, you are solely responsible for any water that drains onto your property, regardless of where it originates. In U.S. legal terms, this is known as the common enemy rule. Surface water is seen as a common enemy to all landowners. If water collects on your property — even if it flows from your neighbor's yard — the responsibility falls to you.

Block2_Paragraph 2 MATCHED

	That said, there are exceptions, which is where the civil law rule comes into play.

Block2_Paragraph 3 MATCHED

	The civil law rule states that if your neighbor changes the natural flow of water on their land in such a way that results in harm to another homeowner, then they may be held liable for any resulting harm. In other words, if the folks next door have installed any new landscaping or structures that change the way water flows on their property, then they could be held responsible for any damage to your property.

Block2_Paragraph 4 MATCHED

	Whether your neighbor is responsible or not, the bottom line here is that you’ll want to figure out a way to divert the water away from your property. Need some simple solutions to deal with your neighbor’s water runoff? Here are some of the best methods out there.

Block2_Sub Heading 5 MATCHED

	1. Build a Berm

Block2_Paragraph 6 MATCHED

	One of the most effective ways of preventing water from reaching your home is to construct a raised barrier made of soil called a berm. Not only are berms effective and generally easy to install, but they also add to the aesthetic value of your property. Berms can be covered with plants, grasses and stone, and can — if done correctly — even boost property value.

Block2_Paragraph 7 MATCHED

	When constructing a berm, you’ll want to keep a few general rules in mind. First, carefully plan out your project and consider the best placement for the berm. They should be built in areas where you’ve noticed the most standing water after heavy rain. However, keep in mind that an ill-placed berm could lead to water diverted into an area where you don’t want it to go.

	Berm Building: Start Small

Block2_Paragraph 9 MATCHED

	Because berm placement can be tricky, it’s recommended that you build a small berm at first and add to it as needed. To prevent excess erosion, make sure that you pack your dirt carefully, as heavy rains can easily wash away loose dirt. Use topsoil as a top layer, clay-like soil as a second layer and fill dirt for your base.

Block2_Paragraph 10 MATCHED

	To avoid unnecessary erosion, make sure your berm is roughly 4 to 5 times wider than it is long and that it maintains a gradual slope. Finally, try to construct your berm in a crescent shape instead of a straight line. Crescent-shaped berms typically divert water more effectively and are also more pleasing to the eye.

	2. Install a French Drain System

Block2_Paragraph 12 MATCHED

	Another effective way to help divert water away from your home is to install a French drain on your property. French drains are long, surface-level trenches that channel water downhill and away from undesirable locations. And while they may sound like pretty complicated drainage systems, they’re actually quite simple. French drains are essentially long ditches with a perforated pipe laid into them. When it rains, excess water flows into the pipe through the holes and travels downhill. Out of sight, out of mind, right?

Block2_Sub Heading 13 MATCHED

	Plan Accordingly

Block2_Paragraph 14 MATCHED

	Installing a French drain can be relatively easy, but depending on the size and scope of your drainage issue, it can also be rather time-consuming. As you start to plan your project, find any downhill slope near where water collects. If you can’t find one, you’ll need to create one by digging your trench deeper as you progress. Your best bet is to have a roughly 1-foot drop for every hundred feet in length, but it doesn’t need to be perfect. You’ll just want to make sure that there are no spots along your route where water can collect and pool.

Block2_Sub Heading 15 MATCHED

	Lay Your Pipe

Block2_Paragraph 16 MATCHED

	Once you dig your trench, cover the inside with landscape fabric and then fill it with crushed stone or gravel. The gravel will primarily be a bedding for the perforated pipe, but it will also help keep dirt and other debris from clogging the drain. From there, just lay your pipe, cover it with additional gravel and backfill the drain with soil. Bear in mind that, while French drains are excellent water drainage solutions, they only have a roughly 5-year lifespan before their effectiveness wears off and they need to be replaced.

	3. Create a Catch Basin

Block2_Paragraph 20 MATCHED

	A catch basin is a buried reservoir with a grate at the top and an outlet where an attached drain pipe redirects surface water away from your home. Note that catch basins are specifically designed for diverting large flooded areas, whereas French drains are best suited for more soggy ground. If the water coming from your neighbor’s property is being dumped in large volumes in a specific location, then a catch basin is your best bet.

Heading 2: < Don’t Let the Situation Drain You > MATCHED

Block3_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	Even if your neighbor is not at fault, having their water runoff into your yard can be an awkward situation. Luckily, there are several drainage options that are both affordable and fairly simple. However, if your drainage issues are causing significant damage to your yard or home, it might be better to call in a professional to assess your situation and offer a solution.
