Block1_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	A mudroom is a transitional space between the great outdoors and your pristine hardwood floors. Most families use mudrooms as an informal or secondary entryway, saving the formal foyer for guests. Think of a mudroom as a catch-all where you hang your coats, store your bags and — as the name implies — kick off your muddy boots.

Block1_Paragraph 3 MATCHED

	Once excluded from new builds in favor of open floor plans, mudrooms are increasing in popularity as homeowners want additional space to store their stuff. It also confines the mess of dirty shoes, drippy umbrellas and sweaty sports equipment to one area. Depending on the size of the space, it may also function as a sitting area or laundry room.

Heading 1: < Key Elements > MATCHED

Block2_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	Here are some of the primary considerations for a mudroom:

Block2_Sub Heading 2 MATCHED

	Convenience

Block2_Paragraph 3 MATCHED

	Almost every house has the “front” door that’s mostly for show and some other door that acts as a de facto entrance. Your mudroom should be as close to one of those secondary entrances as possible. Depending on the layout, many mudrooms sit adjacent to doors that lead in from the garage or backyard.

Block2_Sub Heading 4 MATCHED

	A Place to Sit

Block2_Paragraph 5 MATCHED

	Adding Pinterest-worthy bench seating or even an accent chair will encourage household members and guests to slow down and take their shoes off.

Block2_Sub Heading 6 MATCHED

	Storage

Block2_Paragraph 7 MATCHED

	Mudrooms often have wall-to-wall storage of all kinds: bins, baskets, hooks, cubbies, cabinets and more. Popular trends include cabinetry, bookshelves and storage benches. You can customize cubbies to accommodate sports gear, outdoor toys or gardening tools.

Block2_Sub Heading 8 MATCHED

	Waterproof

Block2_Paragraph 9 MATCHED

	“Mud” is quite literally the name of the game, so expect this space to get dirty. Most mudrooms have stain-resistant paint or paneling and easy-to-clean flooring like tile or vinyl. You’ll want to stay away from materials that aren’t water-resistant, like carpet and hardwood.

Block2_Sub Heading 10 MATCHED

	Optional Extras

Block2_Paragraph 11 MATCHED

	Many mudrooms double as laundry rooms. Soiled clothes can go directly into the washer or hamper without having to be tracked through the rest of the house.

Block2_Paragraph 12 MATCHED

	These days, the first thing many of us do when we enter the house is wash our hands. A utility sink — and perhaps some extra counter space — can make a great handwashing station just inside the door. If you're the outdoorsy type, you may consider adding a full shower or foot washing station in your mudroom.

Block2_Paragraph 13 MATCHED

	Pet owners often use the space to store pet food, toys and other items. If your pup likes to play in the mud, too, a dog washing station might be a useful addition.

	Maybe you aren’t too keen on knocking down or adding any walls just to create a space for your grubby gear. You can set up a sort of mudroom-lite in a hallway, coat closet or a corner of your kitchen. Add elements like a hall tree, wall hooks, storage bench or shoe rack for all the same function without taking up as much space.
