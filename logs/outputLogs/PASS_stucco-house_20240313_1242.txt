	Selecting a material for your home's exterior is an important decision. Siding impacts not only your home’s appearance, but also its value, maintenance needs and resistance from the elements. Stucco is a durable and attractive option that can last for decades when properly installed and maintained.

Complexity of architecture
Type of stucco
Labor costs

	Materials

Block2_Paragraph 4 MATCHED

	Stucco materials cost between $5 and $6 (CAD 6.50 to CAD 7.50) per square foot, though higher quality materials may cost more. Most types of stucco require you to apply three coats to a home's surface, but one-coat stucco is available. One-coat stucco is more expensive but requires less labor to install. Weather-repellent treatments also cost extra but increase longevity.

	Installation

Block2_Paragraph 6 MATCHED

	Installation is a big part of the cost to stucco a house. Labor prices range from $2 to $3 (CAD 2.50 to CAD 4) per square foot. These factors can complicate installation, leading to higher labor costs:

Block2_Paragraph 8 MATCHED

	Although you can avoid labor costs by doing the job yourself, you'll probably want to hire a professional. Poor installation can cause cracking and chipping, which ruin the stucco's durability. To install stucco yourself, you’ll have to purchase special tools and safety equipment. You’ll also need favorable weather and a properly prepared application surface.

Heading 2: < Total Cost to Stucco a House > MATCHED

Block3_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	The overall cost to stucco a house depends on the factors listed above. Here are some average rates for homes of different sizes to help you estimate costs:

	A larger, 2,500-square-foot home can cost between $15,000 and $20,000 (CAD 19,200 and CAD 25,700) to stucco. Pricing ultimately depends on exterior square footage and other factors. Exterior Insulation and Finish Systems provide extra protection against damage and weather and cost an extra $3 to $5 (CAD 4 to CAD 6.50) per square foot.

Block4_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	Stucco tends to be more expensive to install than other types of siding, but it may save you money over time because it's more durable than other options. For comparison, vinyl siding costs about $4 to $15 (CAD 5 to CAD 19) per square foot. Total costs for a 1,500-square-foot exterior range from about $6,000 to $23,000 (CAD 7,800 to CAD 29,500). Cedar or other wood siding typically costs between $7,000 and $23,000 (CAD 9,000 and CAD 29,500) for whole-house installation.

Heading 4: < Should I Avoid Buying a Home With Stucco Siding? > MATCHED

Block5_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	Stucco is a high-quality material, but it does have some downsides. In areas with clay or expansive soils, stucco siding can be problematic since it's susceptible to cracking when foundations shift or settle. Stucco may not be the best choice for homes facing exceptional precipitation or ground moisture, either.

Block5_Paragraph 2 MATCHED

	Even in normal climates, moisture can leak through cracked stucco, damaging the stucco as well as the underlying home. Repairing this damage can be tricky, and professionals may charge between $8 and $50 (CAD 10 and CAD 65) per square foot for stucco repairs, including the cost of materials.

Block5_Paragraph 3 MATCHED

	However, stucco can also be resilient and long-lasting, especially in dry, sunny climates. You may be able to do minor repairs yourself, and stucco can be painted with regular house paint if desired.

	HGTV says well-maintained stucco is an impressive, high-value improvement that can increase a home's curb appeal and value. However, stucco that's cracked or damaged won't have the same impact.
