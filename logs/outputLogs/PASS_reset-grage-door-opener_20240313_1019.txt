	Most modern garage-door openers have a button on them that can be used to reprogram the unit. This will usually be labeled as either “LEARN” or “HOME,” depending on the make of the device. There should be an LED next to that button that indicates the current status of the unit.

	You will need to open the garage door to find the reset button. It will most likely be concealed in a box next to the motor unit.

	To reset a garage-door opener manually using the opener unit, locate the LEARN or HOME button. Press and hold that button for several seconds until the LED next to the unit goes out. This will reset the unit and unlink any remote-control devices that were associated with it.

	You will then need to manually re-pair each remote with the garage-door opener unit, just as you did when you first installed the garage-door opener.

Block5_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	If you've lost your opener remote or forgotten the code so you can't even use the control panel, you may need to open your garage door manually. Electronic garage-door opener units come with a key that you can use in the event of an emergency or power failure. Opening and closing garage doors is just a matter of using this key and pulling the emergency release handle or cable.

Block5_Paragraph 2 MATCHED

	If you're inside the garage and the control panel or mechanism fails, you can open the garage door from the inside using the emergency release mechanism.
