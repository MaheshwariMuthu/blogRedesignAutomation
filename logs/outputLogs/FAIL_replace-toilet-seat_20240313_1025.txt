	Your toilet seat may not seem like an integral element of your home. However, it’s something you use multiple times a day. You need to be able to count on it being in good condition so you can be comfortable. After years of use, some toilet seats can become loose, bend or crack. And at that point, it’s time to replace them.

Block2_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	No. There is no one-size-fits-all solution for toilet seats. Because there are so many shapes and styles of toilets, there are a variety of toilet seats on the market to match. There are, however, two standard toilet seat shapes. While some older toilets have a round bowl shape, others have a more modern, elongated design that requires an oval toilet seat.

Block3_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	The best way to go about finding the right toilet seat for your toilet is to take accurate measurements of your toilet bowl before shopping. Measure the width of the bowl at the widest point. To measure length, place your tape measure exactly between the seat bolts at the back and across to the front edge of the bowl. On average, you'll find that elongated toilet bowls are roughly 18 inches long, while round ones are approximately 16.5 inches long.

	Step 1: Remove the Old Toilet Seat

Block6_Paragraph 4 MATCHED

	There may be plastic caps covering the bolts at the back of your toilet seat. Start by popping these open to expose the bolts. Grab your screwdriver and unscrew the two bolts that are holding the toilet seat in place. Use your pliers to hold the nuts underneath the toilet bowl while you turn the bolts with the screwdriver. Unscrew until the bolts come loose, removing the old seat.

	To cleanly remove the nuts on the bottom, you may need to apply penetrating oil and let it sit overnight.

Block6_Paragraph 8 MATCHED

	The open bolt holes may look dirty or stained. Before you install the new toilet seat, give them a thorough cleaning. You can do this effectively using baking soda, which will remove any traces of dirt or rust. When the toilet bowl looks clean and shiny, you're ready to install the new toilet seat.

	Step 3: Install the New Toilet Seat

Block6_Paragraph 10 MATCHED

	Grab your new toilet seat and position it so it's aligned with the holes in your toilet. Reinsert the bolts and tighten them with your screwdriver while simultaneously tightening the nuts on the bottom by hand. When the nuts are tight, use pliers to hold them in place and continue tightening the bolts with your screwdriver. Be careful not to overtighten the bolts because this can damage the porcelain.
