	If you live near a busy road or have inconsiderate, night-owl neighbors, you know just how frustrating and distressing noise pollution can be. It can be especially distracting if it occurs during the day while you work from home or if it causes sleepless nights. If you’re dealing with unwanted noise, soundproofing might be your solution.

	Soundproofing materials cost $150 to $300 (CAD 200 to CAD 400), based on data from Music Strive. Tools and labor make up the bulk of the bill.

	What you’ll pay depends on the soundproofing materials you use and whether it's just the walls that need soundproofing or if there’s other work that needs to be done, such as soundproofing windows or the ceiling.

Block2_Paragraph 4 MATCHED

	There are many soundproofing materials that can be used. Some items, such as carpeting and textured wall panels or acoustic tiles, are quite easy to install.  Some common soundproofing materials, such as spray foam insulation, may need to be applied by a professional, but the foam itself is quite affordable — between $1 and $3 (CAD 1.33 and CAD 4) per square foot.

Block3_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	The cost to soundproof a wall depends on the material used. Acoustic tiles are very effective at dampening sound. They cost around $5 (CAD 7) per 4-inch by 4-inch tile. A layer of soundproofing drywall is comparatively cheap. Sheets of soundproof drywall are around $40 to $60 (CAD 50 to CAD 80) each, and they’re easy to install. Hanging drywall is a job that some moderately experienced DIYers can do themselves. The relative affordability of the materials means that even if you make mistakes, you won't end up spending too much to fix them.

Block4_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	If you're faced with the need for a soundproof room, the costs may be the least of your worries. Whether you're trying to reduce incoming noise for your own sanity or eliminate outgoing sounds to avoid annoying your neighbors, it's hard to put a price on comfort and peace of mind.

Block4_Paragraph 2 MATCHED

	Soundproofing can be expensive if you have a large room and want to seal it completely. If you're trying to make a recording studio, for example, the cost of soundproofing ceilings, windows and walls will mount. If you're just hoping to cut down on noise reaching a bedroom, however, it will be more affordable and most likely worth the improvement in how well you sleep.

	Carpets: Thick underlay and carpets can reduce sound transmission to those living below or in an adjacent property.
Wall hangings and curtains: Tapestries, rugs and thick soundproof curtains can help cut down on the transmission of ambient sound from room to room.
Acoustic matting: Musicians often use acoustic foam to create a soundproof room for recording and to stop loud music from irritating neighbors. Acoustic foam is expensive — with tiles costing up to $434 (CAD 579) each from Walmart — but it has good sound-insulating properties.
Textured paint: Popcorn ceilings and textured wall decorations can absorb more sound than their smooth counterparts. The insulating properties of paint aren't going to be enough to drown out loud music, but painting can help cut down on the transmission of average noises.
