Block3_Paragraph 3 MATCHED

	Once your Google Nest Hub is switched on and you've downloaded the Google Home app on your smartphone or another device, open the app and click on the plus sign. You'll then see a menu of options. Select “Set Up New Device” and then select “New Device.”

Block3_Paragraph 4 MATCHED

	Select which home your device is in, and click on the next option. The app will search for your Google Nest Hub automatically. You can create multiple homes if you want to use your hub to interact with devices in several locations.

Block3_Paragraph 5 MATCHED

	Once the app finds your Google Nest Hub, click “Yes” to begin connecting. If nothing comes up, make sure that your phone's Bluetooth isn't switched off. Standing closer to the hub can also make it easier to find during the initial setup.

Block3_Paragraph 6 MATCHED

	The app and your Google Nest Hub will now show a code, and you should check they're the same before clicking next. Read and accept the terms and conditions and decide whether you want the app to share service reports with Google. Doing so allows Google to improve its services, but it's not mandatory and won't affect your hub's functionality.

Block3_Paragraph 7 MATCHED

	Click on the room your hub is kept in and select “Next.” Ensure that your smart device is connected to the same Wi-Fi network you want your hub to use, and select the network from the app menu. You'll receive a series of prompts to customize your Google Nest Hub's settings.

	The Google Nest Hub doesn't function like a regular tablet or smartphone, so you can't download or access apps using the device. Instead, Google Nest Hub features “Actions,” which allow you to carry out straightforward functions. According to XDA Developers, there is some evidence that Google is working on making apps available on Google Nest Hub in the future, but it's unclear when this update will become widely available.
