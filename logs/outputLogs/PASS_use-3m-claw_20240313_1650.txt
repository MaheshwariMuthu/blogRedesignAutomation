	When hanging heavy paintings, mirrors and wall art on drywall, it's important to ensure you've got the appropriate hanging hardware needed to safely withstand the weight of the piece. While nails, screws and different types of bolts are often used to handle heavy-duty hanging jobs, you can save yourself time and alleviate the worry of potentially damaging your walls with the help of 3M Claw drywall mounts or similar products from a variety of brands.

	3M Claw drywall mounts are professionally engineered steel claws that lock into drywall with a quick push of your thumbs, eliminating the need for hammers, drills and overly sticky adhesive backing. The drywall hooks are available in multiple sizes to effectively hang items weighing between 15 and 65 pounds, and they come with convenient spot markers to ensure balanced hanging. Here’s a quick user guide.

Block2_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	3M Claw picture hangers are highly efficient and work well to securely mount heavier items ranging from framed artwork to large mirrors. The claw feature on each mount secures itself inside the drywall to provide a sturdy foundation, and the mount's outer hook is compatible with D-ring, wire and sawtooth frame hardware.

Block3_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	3M Claw hangers are specifically designed to cause minimal damage to walls compared to hammers and nails, which can leave significant dings when used incorrectly. While the two claw hooks on each mount push deep into the drywall for a firm and lasting hold, they only leave small cosmetic holes that can easily be repaired with a quick application of spackle.

	The 3M Claw comes with step-by-step instructions to guide you through the process of mounting heavy hanging items with D-ring, sawtooth and wire hardware. To use the 3M Claw, follow these basic instructions:

Block4_Paragraph 3 MATCHED

	1. Determine the weight of your item and choose a weight-compatible claw hanger. (See below.)

Block4_Paragraph 4 MATCHED

	2. Attach the adhesive side of the included marker to the back of your frame in the same spot in which you would usually place a nail. For wire and D-ring frames, use a pencil to mark the area prior to placing the marker.

	3. Determine the spot on the wall where you want to hang the piece, and gently press the frame against the wall so the adhesive side of the marker sticks to the wall.

	4. Set the frame aside and take a pencil to mark the wall in the bottom notch of the marker.

	5. Remove the marker from the wall and set it aside.

	6. Take the 3M Claw and position the bottom notch of the hanger directly above the wall mark, ensuring the "claw" portion is pointing towards the wall.

	7. Press firmly with both thumbs until the claws are deep into the wall and the hanger is flush against the wall.

	8. Hang the frame on the hook via the wire, D-rings or sawtooth hardware.

	9. Make minor adjustments to ensure the frame is level.

Block5_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	3M drywall hooks are specifically engineered to work with drywall — not plaster and lathe walls. For best results, use the 3M frame hanger only as directed.

Block6_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	When using the 3M Claw picture hangers, be sure to follow all provided instructions and only use hooks that match the weight of your frame. For example, the 3M Claw is available in 15-, 25-, 45- and 65-pound weight limits. For frames and wall art 15 pounds or less, use the 15-pound hook. If you have a 35-pound piece, err on the side of caution and use the 45-pound hook.
