	Compared to real stone siding, stone veneer siding is a relatively affordable way to upgrade your house's appearance, but it's important to understand the costs involved before committing.

Heading 1: < What Is Stone Veneer Siding? > MATCHED

Block2_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	Stone veneer siding creates the appearance of rustic natural stone. Manufacturers typically produce stone veneer siding by pouring a mixture of Portland cement, aggregates and colorants into stone-shaped molds. However, you can also purchase stone veneer panels made from thin slices of natural stone or molded polyurethane.

Block2_Paragraph 2 MATCHED

	The primary advantage of this type of siding is that it provides a traditional aesthetic. However, it's much easier to install than solid stone because it's significantly lighter, and you can choose between multiple color options and decorative finishes. You can install stone veneer siding to create a durable, decorative layer on exterior walls and chimneys or to embellish interior features such as fireplaces.
