	Screening in an existing porch costs between $4 and $8 (CAD 5 and CAD 9) per square foot, and the total price depends on its size and the quality of the materials chosen. Most homeowners pay between $1,200 and $2,700 (CAD 1,600 and CAD 3,600) to screen in a 300-square-foot porch.

	It would cost much more to build a porch from scratch. Simple patio enclosures cost less than large and luxurious wraparound porches made from the highest quality materials.

	Building a porch enclosure from scratch costs more than just adding some screens. If you're hoping to build a fully enclosed and covered porch, you should expect to spend between $25 and $120 (CAD 33 and 160) per square foot, according to data from HomeLight. Your new porch could cost around $4,600 to $22,000 (CAD 6,200 to CAD 29,500) in total, plus an additional $2,000 to $2,800 (CAD 2,700 to CAD 3,800) for screening in.

	Some things that might bump up the price include the choice of roofing materials and installation costs for things like a ceiling fan or infrared heater. You can keep the cost of your project low by keeping the project simple to begin with. A covered porch with screen doors is a good starting point, and you can add ceiling fans and other accessories later as your budget allows.

	When getting quotes from contractors, ask for them to be itemized so that you can confirm what's covered. Don't forget expenses such as clearing space in the yard or taking away debris. These are things contractors often forget and may prove to be an unexpected extra expense.

Block4_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	Building a screened-in porch is a major home improvement project that requires some level of DIY skill. If you're building a porch and adding screens to it, you'll need to take into account planning-related issues and consider the cost of the materials, building work and removal of debris and waste materials.

Block4_Paragraph 2 MATCHED

	Even simple patio enclosures cost hundreds of dollars in materials and will take care and planning to build. Building a porch from scratch is not an unachievable task for an amateur DIYer, but adding a cover and screen makes the job that much more complex. If you've not taken on such a construction project before, it may be best to hire a contractor to add a screened porch for you.

Block4_Paragraph 3 MATCHED

	Plan your screened-in porch or patio carefully. Remember that it's easier to upgrade a suitably sized porch with extras than it is to make a too-small porch larger. If you want to be able to use the porch with a table and chairs in it as a family gathering area during the summer, aim for at least 16 feet by 20 feet. Anything smaller will most likely feel too cramped.
