	Putting up walls in your relationships is generally considered to be counterproductive — but putting up walls in your house could work wonders for those same relationships. Plus, if you elect to do the drywall work yourself, you’ll further endear yourself to your fellow housemates as a guy or gal who can get things done while saving a cool $1 to $3 per square foot on professional installation for a job you can do relatively easily yourself.

	Start in a corner and measure out.
Make sure your pieces end in the center of a joist.
Mark your drywall piece, using a utility knife score the paper.
Stand the piece up and snap the waste part away.

	Have an assistant hold the drywall piece up while you attach the board using screws.
Make sure you use at least five screws on each side and screws are placed a half-inch from the edge.
Your screws should be lined around the edges and the width and length of drywall.

	Starting at where the ceiling and corner meet, use a tape measure to ensure the piece will end on a stud and, if not, make sure you cut the drywall pieces down.
Hold the piece against the ceiling panel and wall, and attach it with screws.
Hang pieces along the top of the wall over windows and doorways.

Heading 6: < Step 6: Trim Around Doors and Windows > MATCHED

	Install the next row of drywall like you did in Step 4, making sure to butt the edges tightly.
Make sure you cut out switch and outlet boxes with the same procedure as you did in Step 3.
With a cutout tool, trim any ends and edges into the window and doorway flush with the opening.

Heading 7: < Step 7: Make Inside and Outside Corners > MATCHED

	On inside corners, simply butt the end of the drywall against the other one.

Repeat steps as needed.
