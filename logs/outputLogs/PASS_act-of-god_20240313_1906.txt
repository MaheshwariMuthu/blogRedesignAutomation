Block2_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	According to Policy Genius, an act of God is any type of natural event that is considered out of human control. Common acts of God covered in standard insurance policies include hurricanes, wildfires and hailstorms, while complex disasters, such as earthquakes and severe flooding, are generally not covered.

Heading 3: < Is ‘Force Majeure’ the Same as an Act of God? > MATCHED

Block4_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	According to the Lien Zone, the term “force majeure” refers to events caused by human error and human acts. Examples of force majeure acts include electrical system failure, terrorist acts, acts of war and labor disputes.

Block4_Paragraph 2 MATCHED

	While a common belief is that force majeure acts and acts of God are one and the same in terms of insurance policies, the two phrases have different meanings. Acts of God, in terms of insurance policies, are situations that occur in which humans have no control over and no ability to control, like the natural disasters we mentioned.

Block4_Paragraph 3 MATCHED

	Force majeure clauses in contracts and insurance policies free parties from personal liabilities and contractual obligations when an extraordinary event caused by a person or persons occurs that is out of their control.

Block4_Paragraph 4 MATCHED

	For example, if a strike, riot or system failure directly resulted in a business owner being unable to pay their insurance premiums, the business owner would not be liable due to the force majeure clause. Force majeure provisions are often included in commercial contracts. These provisions specifically state the obligations of all parties if they are no longer able to fulfil their contractual obligations.

	In most cases, standard homeowner insurance policies have common acts of God clauses that provide coverage for certain types of fires, hailstorms, thunderstorms, windstorms and hurricanes. To find out exactly what your insurance policy covers, Insure.com says you can start by reading your policy's declaration page.

Block6_Paragraph 2 MATCHED

	The declaration page on an insurance policy names the insured individuals, along with their insurance agent and lenders (when applicable). It clearly lists all areas of coverage, premium amounts, deductibles and discounts, making it easy for policyholders to determine which acts of God are covered. Declaration pages provide a wide range of information, so be sure to consult with your insurance agent if you are unclear on coverage specifics.
