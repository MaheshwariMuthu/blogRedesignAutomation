	Ground-Source or Geothermal Heat Pump

Block3_Paragraph 3 MATCHED

	A geothermal or ground-source heat pump uses heat from the earth to warm your home. These systems are generally the most expensive to purchase and install, but they can save you a significant amount on your energy bills because they're highly efficient.

Block3_Paragraph 6 MATCHED

	Water-source heat pumps transfer heat from a body of water to your home. They're usually highly efficient, so you may make back some of the installation cost in utility bill savings. The average cost to purchase and install a water-source heat pump system is around $22,000 (CAD 30,187), according to Modernize. Most homeowners spend between $20,000 and $25,000 (CAD 27,443 and CAD 34,304) for the heat pump itself, plus installation.

Block3_Sub Heading 7 MATCHED

	Air-Source Heat Pump

Block3_Paragraph 8 MATCHED

	Air-source heat pumps transfer heat from the air inside your home to the outside in hot weather and move heat from the outside air inside when it gets cold. The average air-source heat pump costs between $4,000 and $8,000 (CAD 5,489 and CAD 10,977) installed, according to HomeGuide.

	The most affordable air-source heat pumps are ductless heat pumps, costing between $1,500 and $5,000 (CAD 2,058 and CAD 6,861), based on data from This Old House.

Block3_Sub Heading 10 MATCHED

	Hybrid Heat Pump

Block3_Paragraph 11 MATCHED

	Hybrid heat pump systems combine a heat pump with a regular gas furnace. They're a suitable option for homes in cooler climates because the heat pump provides energy-efficient heating in moderate temperatures while the furnace provides additional heat during cold weather.

Block3_Paragraph 12 MATCHED

	The average cost to buy and install a hybrid heat pump system is $2,500 to $6,000 (CAD 3,430 to CAD 8,233) if you connect it to an existing furnace. Installing a new furnace will increase your costs to around $4,500 to $10,000 (CAD 6,175 to CAD 13,722).
