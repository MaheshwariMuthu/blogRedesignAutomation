Block1_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	If you’re apartment hunting, you’ve probably noticed that one of the pieces you need before your landlord hands you your keys is proof of a renters insurance policy. While it’s not required across the board, many property owners or buildings want to see that you have some amount of insurance coverage before you can move in. The good news is that a yearly renters insurance premium probably costs less than the new TV you just bought or the living room set arriving next week.

	Where Do You Live?

Block2_Paragraph 3 MATCHED

	Where the policy is purchased is a significant part of the cost. For example, renters in areas that are regularly hit by hurricanes and other big storms can experience higher insurance costs. Additionally, policies cover theft — both at your home and, in many cases, your car. If you live in a high-crime neighborhood, the policy is likely more expensive.

	What Coverage Level Do You Need?

Block2_Paragraph 5 MATCHED

	This one's simpler to understand. The more coverage you need, the higher the annual cost. However, it's not advisable to choose a less expensive policy just to save money. People that experience a loss might find less coverage is actually more expensive in the long run.

Block2_Sub Heading 6 MATCHED

	Do You Need Medical Payment Coverage?

Block2_Paragraph 7 MATCHED

	Medical coverage can help cover the cost of injuries to you or guests at your property. If you choose too low of a coverage amount, you might have to pay out of pocket for any expenses that exceed your policy.

Block2_Sub Heading 8 MATCHED

	What’s Your Deductible?

Block2_Paragraph 9 MATCHED

	A deductible is the amount you need to pay out before your insurance company will pay a claim. A higher deductible typically results in a lower annual premium cost.

Block2_Sub Heading 10 MATCHED

	What’s Your Credit History?

Block2_Paragraph 11 MATCHED

	Poor credit history may increase the average cost you have to pay for renters insurance. You may have to shop around for a company to find the best coverage.

Heading 2: < How Much Should I Be Paying For Renters Insurance? > MATCHED

Block3_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	You need enough coverage to protect your lifestyle in the event of a loss. This amount varies from person to person. For example, a family of four has more insurance needs than a young, single person just starting their career. While you don't want to pay for too much coverage, it's better to be safe than sorry.

If you've just moved out on your own, your personal property may be valued at a small amount that $20,000 could cover. However, in many cases, people spend well over $20,000 on essential living purchases over the years.

Heading 5: < Is Renters Insurance Cheaper Than Homeowners Insurance? > MATCHED
