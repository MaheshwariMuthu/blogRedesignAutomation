	Fencing can be a great way to define your property, increase your privacy and give your kids and pets a safe place to play. These days, you have more options than ever when it comes to materials. Vinyl is a great alternative to traditional wood or chain-link. It’s attractive, durable and virtually maintenance-free. There’s no need to worry about rust, rot or water damage, either. Plus, installing a vinyl fence can be a DIY project.

	You’ll need the right tools and some experience using them, but installing a vinyl fence is a relatively straightforward process.

Block2_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	Installing any type of fence can be a laborious process, and vinyl fences are no different. The biggest challenge when installing a vinyl fence is setting the posts correctly. To ensure the integrity of your new fence, they must be set in a straight line, perfectly spaced and level. Once that’s done, installing the vinyl panels is fairly simple.

Block2_Paragraph 2 MATCHED

	If you plan on completing a vinyl fence installation on your own, you’ll need to have basic carpentry skills and access to standard tools such as a drill, level and circular saw.

	Vinyl fences typically come as preassembled panels, which you can find at most large home improvement stores. The type of fence you choose depends on your needs. There are three basic vinyl fence styles:

Block3_Sub Heading 2 MATCHED

	Picket

Block3_Paragraph 3 MATCHED

	Picket fences are ideal for homeowners who want a traditional aesthetic. At a height of 4 feet or less, picket fences can define boundaries and corral children or small dogs without blocking the view from your deck.

Block3_Sub Heading 4 MATCHED

	Privacy

Block3_Paragraph 5 MATCHED

	Privacy fences generally stand between 4 to 6 feet tall, providing a solid barrier that’s ideal for concealing unsightly views or busy roadways. They’re great for containing larger dogs or for setting apart a swimming pool or children’s play area. Privacy fences may include post toppers, latticework or other decorative elements.

Block3_Sub Heading 6 MATCHED

	Shadowbox

Block3_Paragraph 7 MATCHED

	Shadowbox fences use alternating boards to create an identical look on both sides of the fence. They often have the look and height of a privacy fence, but they won’t block the breeze.

	If you have basic carpentry skills and access to standard tools, you should be able to install your own vinyl fence. Just follow these eight steps to get started:

Block5_Sub Heading 2 MATCHED

	1. Stake Your Claim

Block5_Paragraph 3 MATCHED

	Using landscape stakes, stake out your intended fence line. Be sure to account for corners and gates.

Block5_Sub Heading 4 MATCHED

	2. Mark Your Territory

Block5_Paragraph 5 MATCHED

	Define the fence line by tying a string or mason line between corner posts. Alternately, you may use spray paint to mark off the area.

Block5_Sub Heading 6 MATCHED

	3. Plan Post Position

Block5_Paragraph 7 MATCHED

	Decide where each post will go. For this step, you’ll need to know the exact measurement of your fence panels so you can place your posts properly. Vinyl fence panels can’t be trimmed, so double check your measurements and mark the position with a stake, making sure it touches the layout string.

Block5_Paragraph 10 MATCHED

	Dig the post holes using a power auger or post hole digger. The holes should be about 10 inches in diameter and deep enough to hold about one-third of the pole’s length plus 6 inches of gravel backfill. Gate posts and main supports should generally be 6 inches deeper than other posts to increase strength. All post holes should comply with local codes.

	5. Fill ’Er Up!

Block5_Paragraph 12 MATCHED

	Pour 6 inches of gravel into each hole and fill the holes with quick-set concrete.

	6. Post Up

Block5_Paragraph 15 MATCHED

	Starting with the main posts, insert a post into each hole and tap it down until it reaches the level of the gravel. Make sure each post is level and plumb before moving on to the next.

Block5_Sub Heading 16 MATCHED

	7. Attach Hardware

Block5_Paragraph 17 MATCHED

	Once the concrete has fully set, you can begin to install the hardware that supports the fence panels. First, attach the rail brackets to each post, then slide the vinyl panels onto the brackets and fasten them using the appropriate screws.

Block5_Sub Heading 18 MATCHED

	8. Don’t Forget the Gate

Block5_Paragraph 19 MATCHED

	Install the gate and any additional accessories — such as solar lights or post toppers — according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Block5_Paragraph 20 MATCHED

	If you get stuck, your best bet is to check the manufacturer's instructions that came with your fencing materials. Most manufacturers also have hotlines or websites where DIYers can get additional guidance.

	Here are the answers to some frequently asked questions about vinyl fence installation:

Block6_Sub Heading 2 MATCHED

	How Much Does It Cost to Install a Vinyl Fence?

Block6_Paragraph 3 MATCHED

	Vinyl fence installation costs vary depending on the amount of fencing you need, the style of fence you choose and the inclusion of gates, post toppers or other decorative elements. The cost may also be impacted by the location. Installing a fence on uneven ground can be substantially more expensive than installing the same fence on flat ground.

	HowMuch.net|https://howmuch.net/costs/vinyl-fence-installation

Block6_Paragraph 4 MATCHED

	According to HowMuch.net, standard materials may range from about $12 to $18 per linear foot for a simple picket fence, to around $35 to $45 per linear foot for a shadowbox design. Privacy fences fall somewhere in the middle, with a price range that’s usually between $25 and $35 per linear foot. Costs may be higher if you opt for a woodgrain appearance or a color other than white.

Block6_Paragraph 5 MATCHED

	If you hire a professional installer, expect to pay $3 to $6 more per linear foot for installation. This doesn’t include site prep costs such as clearing away rocks and trees or grading the land.

	Do Vinyl Fence Posts Need Wood Posts?

Block6_Paragraph 7 MATCHED

	If you’re installing a vinyl fence, you’ll want to ensure stability and longevity. This can be done by reinforcing corner posts, end posts and gate posts. Many manufacturers recommend reinforcing your posts with metal inserts or using concrete with rebar. Wood inserts are typically not recommended due to their susceptibility to water damage and dry rot. This is true even for pressure-treated lumber. If you’re not sure what you should use to reinforce your fence posts, check out the manufacturer’s guidelines or consult a company representative.

Block6_Sub Heading 8 MATCHED

	How Far Apart Should Fence Posts Be?

Block6_Paragraph 9 MATCHED

	Accurate post spacing is one of the most important aspects of vinyl fence installation. If your posts aren’t spaced properly, they won’t adequately support the fence. The distance between fence posts varies depending on the length of the vinyl panels. It’s important to consult the manufacturer’s guidelines for the exact spacing needed for your chosen materials.
