Heading 1: < What Is an Anti-Vortex Drain Cover? > MATCHED

Block2_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	When you combine a powerful pump with a traditional pool drain cover, it can result in excessive suction, which can trap a swimmer who gets too close. An anti-vortex pool drain cover is a type of safety drain cover that lets more water flow through it so suction is reduced, creating a safer swimming environment, especially for smaller children.

Block3_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	You should install an anti-vortex drain cover to minimize the risk of entrapment in a pool-bottom drain — but safety isn't the only reason to replace an old pool or spa drain cover. If you maintain a public or semipublic pool, the Virginia Graeme Baker Pool and Spa Safety Act mandates the installment of adequate safety features, including anti-entrapment pool covers. Although the legislation doesn't apply to backyard pools, all pool drain covers manufactured now, whether for public or private pools, must comply with the VGB Act.

Heading 3: < How Do I Measure My Pool Drain Cover? > MATCHED

Block4_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	To know which drain cover to buy, you’ll need to measure the diameter of the drain. Because taking measurements underwater can be tricky, you can partially drain your pool for better access, or you can wear a swim mask and snorkel. Using a waterproof ruler or tape measure, measure the drain opening. If your drain is rectangular, measure the length and width. If it's round, measure the diameter.

Block4_Paragraph 2 MATCHED

	You’ll also need to know the diameter of the pool's sump pipe, which leads away from the main drain, and your pool pump's manufacturer, model number and its rate of flow (which you'll find on the pump's label).

Block4_Paragraph 3 MATCHED

	With this information, your local pool supply store should be able to help you select an appropriate anti-vortex drain cover.

	A drain that hasn't reached its expiration date but no longer fits properly or shows signs of wear should be replaced immediately, as it can cause safety risks. You should never allow anyone to enter a pool that has a broken or missing drain cover.
