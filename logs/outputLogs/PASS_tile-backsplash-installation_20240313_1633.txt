	Porcelain tile is a resilient material that resists scratching and cracking. However, it isn't as commonly used as ceramic for backsplashes because there aren't as many finishing options available. Expect to pay between $300 and $1,200 (CAD 390 and CAD 1,600) to have a porcelain tile backsplash installed.

	Marble

Backsplash installation costs range from around $390 (CAD 510) if you use tiles, to $6,000 (CAD 7,800) if you use a solid slab.
