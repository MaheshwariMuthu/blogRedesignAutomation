	We all have at least one in our family: the person who fixes, maintains, updates and upgrades everything themselves. Be it a leaky faucet, a hole in the wall, kitchen remodels or some rotting deck boards, they&#39;ve got it under control. These jack-of-all-trades types can handle seemingly any minor to mid-level home repairs and home improvements — and they&#39;re also likely among the hardest people on your list to shop for when the holidays roll around.

	Have you ever seen someone working on a project and their phone rings or they need to send a quick text Or perhaps they need to watch one more YouTube video to make sure they&#39;re following instructions correctly.

Block4_Paragraph 1 NOT MATCHED

	When you&#39;re constantly juggling home-improvement projects, it can be difficult to keep track of all the tiny screws and nails you&#39;re working with. That&#39;s where a magnetic wristband (like those shown here) comes into play. This clever cuff fits snugly around the wrist, keeping all the little pieces of hardware and tiny tools organized and always within reach. It&#39;s exactly the type of thing no one realizes they need until they get one — then they wonder how they lived without it for so long.

	Every do-it-yourselfer needs a hammer — why not make it a personalized one? Have their hammer engraved, then every time your friend or loved one picks up the hammer and swings it, they&#39;ll think of the person who gave it to them. As an added bonus, a fellow nail-pounder will be less likely to walk off with it accidentally. On the other hand, they may decide their inscribed hammer is too pretty to use and wish to display it instead — but either way, you&#39;ve hammered home the message that you care.

Gone is the need for guesswork as to which mark to read when the device itself calculates the exact span it&#39;s measuring. Pro tip: You might want to buy two and keep one for yourself.

	Now that they have all the tools and books that they could possibly need, what better way to store it all than a brand-new toolbox. Keeping all the tools together from the shop to the house to the deck to the truck is important, and no one wants to have to chase down tools that go missing. If you know someone without a toolbox or who has an old battle-scarred one, treat them to a new, affordable one this holiday season.
