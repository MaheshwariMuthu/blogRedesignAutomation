	How’s life up there in the PNW? We gotta admit, we’re a little jealous of the fresh seafood and gorgeous landscapes — though we could do without the persistent drizzle (why is it, again, that you don’t you use umbrellas?). Washingtonians perhaps know better than anyone: When it rains, it pours. So when your water heater decides it’s quittin’ time, the first thing on your mind is how much it’s going to cost to repair or replace it. Luckily, the average resident of Washington State will pay less to have their water heater serviced than the average American.

	Your water heater powers your dishwasher, clothes washer and the hot shower you crave at the end of a long day of mountain biking, kayaking, surfing or snowshoeing — so it’s almost impossible to live without it. If your hot water is already out, the last thing you want right now is to be blindsided by exorbitant service fees. Calling around for estimates? These figures should give you a general idea of how much you can expect to pay in the Evergreen State.

Block3_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	Any of a number of things may be going wrong with your water heater — issues with the gas control valve, a faulty thermostat or a combination of several malfunctions. This average repair price includes replacement parts and the labor to install them. Repairs cost ’Toners an average of 47% less than the U.S. overall.

Heading 3: < Water Heater Replace: $1,626 > MATCHED

Block4_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	Water heaters only last about 10 years, so a breakdown might be a sign that yours is on its way out. When it’s the end of the road for your water heater, you’ll need to buy a new one. Washington’s average replacement price is about 7% less than the nation’s.

Block4_Paragraph 2 MATCHED

	(Note that HomeServe water heater data should generally be assumed to refer to conventional “tanked” models — the most common type — as opposed to tankless or “on-demand” models, which can cost roughly twice as much.)
