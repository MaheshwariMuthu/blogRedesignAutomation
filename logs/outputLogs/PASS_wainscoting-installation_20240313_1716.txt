	According to data from Fixr, it should take roughly 12 hours for professionals to install wainscoting in a 10-foot by 10-foot room. At an average cost of $90 (CAD 120) per hour, that adds up to $1,080 (CAD 1,450) for labor in all.

Heading 2: < How Much Does Wainscoting Cost to Install Yourself? > MATCHED

Block3_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	Installing wainscoting yourself can trim over $1,000 (CAD 1,350) from the overall project budget, as you won't have to pay for installation labor. For example, installing around 100 square feet of redwood wainscoting yourself should cost somewhere between $1,000 and $1,800 (CAD 1,350 and CAD 2,400). This figure doesn't include the cost of paint or other finishes, so remember to factor this in when calculating the total cost if you want painted wainscoting.

Block3_Paragraph 2 MATCHED

	The type of panels you choose will significantly impact the overall costs. If you choose an expensive wood such as cherry, or if you want panels with an intricate design, this will cost significantly more. Meanwhile, opting for wood veneer or plastic panels is a good way to save money and get the look of wainscoting on a budget.

Block4_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	If you’re doing the project yourself, the largest expense is the panels. Vinyl is the cheapest option, costing between $6 and $10 (CAD 8 and CAD 13) per square foot. Meanwhile, you could spend as much as $28 (CAD 38) per square foot for expensive wainscoting materials like stone veneer.

Block4_Paragraph 2 MATCHED

	You'll also need some basic equipment to install wainscoting, which should cost around $120 (CAD 160) to purchase from a hardware store. If you already have some of the equipment from previous projects, or if you can borrow it from friends or family, this will shave a little off the overall installation cost.

Heading 4: < How Does the Cost of Wainscoting Compare to Shiplap? > MATCHED

Block5_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	Shiplap siding is often a cheaper option than wainscoting. It consists of horizontal panels that provide a rustic, log cabin-style aesthetic. Installing shiplap costs between $9 and $23 (CAD 12 and CAD 31) per square foot.

Block5_Paragraph 2 MATCHED

	However, bear in mind that installation costs are dependent on local labor prices. If you're on a tight budget, it's a bit easier to install shiplap yourself than wainscoting. The materials for DIY shiplap are relatively inexpensive, making it an affordable project for homeowners on a very tight budget.
