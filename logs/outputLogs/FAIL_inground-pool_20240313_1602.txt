	In addition to the size of the pool, shape also matters when determining costs. Inground pools can be freeform or geometric. Freeform pools can be custom shaped to fit into your property's natural contours, while geometric pools are usually rectangular. Geometric and oval-shaped pools are generally the most cost-effective option because they're relatively straightforward to construct. Freeform pools have a greater potential for additional construction costs due to their complexity and are usually more expensive.
