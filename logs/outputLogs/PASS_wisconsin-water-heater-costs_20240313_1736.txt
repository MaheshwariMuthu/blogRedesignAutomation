	Ope! Your water heater’s broke. Now what? Wisconsinites should know that, in your home state, the average cost to repair or replace a water heater is lower than the national average. In other words: Cheeseheads won’t have to spend as much cheddar to fix their water heater woes.

Block1_Paragraph 3 MATCHED

	Your water heater is a pretty important piece of equipment. It’s responsible for your clean clothes, spotless dishes and that hot shower you’re looking forward to. When it goes kaput, it's not so much a matter of whether you should have it serviced, but how much that service will cost. And if your hot water is already out, the last thing you want is to be slapped with sky-high service fees. Curious what it might cost? These figures should give you a ballpark idea of how much you can expect to pay in your state.

	Repair and replacement costs vary depending on where you live. For comparison, the national average for diagnosis is $99, for repair is $493 and for replacement is $1,741.

	The following average prices are based on aggregated HomeServe data reported by our network of contractors across Wisconsin.

Heading 1: < Water Heater Diagnosis: $81 > MATCHED

Block2_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	The diagnostic fee is what the technician will charge you to tell you what’s wrong with your system and whether it needs to be repaired or replaced. In Wisconsin, this fee is about 18% lower than the national average.

Heading 2: < Water Heater Repair: $326 > MATCHED

Block3_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	The price you pay for water heater repairs varies based on the part that’s broken. You might get off easy if you just need to fix the gas shut-off valve, but you’ll be looking at a higher bill if you need to replace the heating elements. This average repair price includes replacement parts and the labor to install them. In the Badger State, repairs cost an average of 34% less than the U.S. overall.

Heading 3: < Water Heater Replace: $1,438 > MATCHED

Block4_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	There comes a point in every water heater’s life (about 10 years) when repairs aren’t enough to get it going again. A breakdown might be a sign that yours is nearing the end of its lifespan and that it’s time to replace it with a new one. Luckily, Wisconsin’s average replacement price is 17% lower than what the average American would pay.

Block4_Paragraph 2 MATCHED

	(Note that HomeServe water heater data should generally be assumed to refer to conventional “tanked” models — the most common type — as opposed to tankless or “on-demand” models, which can cost roughly twice as much.)
