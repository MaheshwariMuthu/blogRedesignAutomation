Block2_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	The most common situation where people need to know their serial number is when they take their computer in for repairs under warranty. If you purchase insurance for your device or get a third-party warranty plan, you may have to supply the serial number so the company can verify which specific device the coverage applies to.

Block2_Paragraph 2 MATCHED

	If your computer gets stolen, you may also have to supply your serial number to the police. Even if the police can't locate your computer, you'll need to provide a police report with the serial number on it to your insurer when you file a claim.

Block3_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	Depending on the manufacturer, your computer’s serial number provides a record of your warranty, including any repairs carried out under warranty. A repair technician can use this information to determine when your computer was made and which components it's compatible with.

Block3_Paragraph 2 MATCHED

	The serial number also verifies who owns the computer. Insurers and the police can use this information to confirm your rightful ownership of the device. Sometimes, investigators can use the serial number to track your computer's whereabouts and recover your property.

Block4_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	Your desktop computer's model number contains information about the device's type, year of manufacture and manufacturer. Therefore, all computers of the same brand and model have the same model number.

Block4_Paragraph 2 MATCHED

	On the other hand, your computer’s serial number is a unique identifier for your exact computer. No other device will share the same serial number.

Block5_Sub Heading 3 MATCHED

	1. Look on the Packaging or Physical Device

Block5_Paragraph 4 MATCHED

	You can find your serial number printed on a sticker attached to the box your computer originally came in. There's also a similar sticker attached to the rear side or back of your device. The location of the sticker varies from brand to brand.

Block5_Paragraph 5 MATCHED

	Your computer may have multiple components — a CPU tower, monitor, keyboard and mouse, for instance. If you are trying to find the serial number of the “computer,” you probably need the serial number that is stamped on the CPU tower. The number on the back of the monitor, in that case, is the serial number for the screen only.

Block5_Paragraph 6 MATCHED

	However, many desktop computers these days are all-in-one models that come without a CPU tower. In that case, the serial number you need is the one on the back of the device.

Block5_Sub Heading 7 MATCHED

	2. Find It on the Computer

Block5_Paragraph 8 MATCHED

	If you threw the box away or removed the device sticker, you can still recover the serial number on a Windows computer by performing a WMIC command prompt.

Block5_Paragraph 9 MATCHED

	Right-click on the “Start” icon and select “Command Prompt (Admin).”

Block5_Paragraph 10 MATCHED

	Enter this code on the pop-up screen: wmic bios get serialnumber

Block5_Paragraph 11 MATCHED

	Hit the enter key. You should see your serial number appear below the code.

Block5_Paragraph 12 MATCHED

	Although this method works for most computers, it might not find your serial number if the manufacturer didn't store it in your device's firmware.

Block5_Sub Heading 13 MATCHED

	3. Look Through the Paperwork

Block5_Paragraph 14 MATCHED

	If a WMIC prompt doesn't work or you don't have your computer on hand, you can try checking your documentation. Your computer’s serial number should appear on your warranty and registration documents.

Block7_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	It's generally wise to keep your serial number secret unless a repair technician or police officer requires it. The chances of someone using your computer’s serial number nefariously are reasonably slim. However, they could potentially use it to obtain repairs through your warranty or claim a replacement device.
