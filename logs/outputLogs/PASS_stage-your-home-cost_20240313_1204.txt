Block1_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	Selling a home can be a stressful experience. In fact, respondents to a 2019 study described selling their home as more stressful than having a baby, teaching a teen to drive or even being fired from work. Perhaps one of the most anxiety-inducing aspects is the time it can take to sell — especially if you're worried about your home's resale value or need to move quickly.

Block1_Paragraph 3 MATCHED

	Home staging could be worth considering if you want the best possible offer without your home languishing on the market. A 2023 report by the National Association of Realtors (NAR) found that 81% of Realtors believe home staging makes it easier for buyers to imagine themselves living in a property. Even better, 21% of Realtors said that house staging increased a home's value by between 1% and 5%. So, what exactly is home staging, and how much does it cost to stage a house?

Heading 1: < What Is Home Staging? > MATCHED

Block2_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	Home staging involves showcasing your home to make it more appealing to potential buyers. Often, this means rearranging and updating furniture and adding neutral home decor. Staging your home can make it easier for buyers to picture themselves living there, potentially increasing your chances of selling.

Block2_Paragraph 2 MATCHED

	How to stage your home depends on several factors, including the condition of your existing furniture and decor. Sometimes, decluttering your home and removing items like family photos is enough to depersonalize it and boost its appeal to a broad range of buyers. However, many sellers transform their homes more radically by renting premium furniture, redecorating and updating their landscaping.

Block2_Paragraph 3 MATCHED

	You can often tackle a small-scale house staging project yourself. Alternatively, consider hiring a professional home stager to improve your home's appearance. This option offers several advantages — professionals often have a selection of neutral furniture and home decor items, and they'll likely know how best to highlight your home's potential.
