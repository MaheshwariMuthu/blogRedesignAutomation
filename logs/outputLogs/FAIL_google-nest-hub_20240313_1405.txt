Heading 4: < What Features Does Google Nest Hub Max Have? > MATCHED

Block5_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	Google Nest Hub Max is the souped-up version of Google Nest Hub, so it has a few added features and technology not seen in the baseline version of the device. The headlining upgrade for the Nest Hub Max is the addition of an on-board camera, something that is lacking in the first two basic Hub (and originally, Google Home Hub) iterations. Some of the features of the Google Nest Hub Max include:

Block5_List 2 MATCHED

	Capability to make video calls and leave video messages using Duo
Google Photos integration for instant sharing of photos with family or friends
Integration with thousands of devices for your smart home, from locks to TVs, lights, game consoles and speakers — all with voice control from a single dashboard
Operation of smart components, including volume control, search, pause and play commands
An HD screen with high-quality speakers for enjoying videos and TV content
Upgraded speakers
Built-in Chromecast for streaming apps or listening to music
Individualized viewing of family member’s calendars and reminders
Hey Google capability
Familiar Face alerts in some markets
Support for up to six users through Google Duo
Works with other Nest and Google components, including Nest thermostats, cameras, doorbells, alarms, smoke alarms and Wi-Fi

Heading 5: < What Are Some Components That Go With the Google Nest Hub? > MATCHED

Block6_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	Google offers dozens of components that integrate easily with its Nest Hub and Nest Hub Max. A few of them include indoor and outdoor cameras, video doorbells, smoke and carbon monoxide alarm units, locks, thermostats and speakers. According to the company, there are over 50,000 smart devices on the market (like TVs, remotes, lights and appliances) made by other brands that can be controlled from the Hub.

Block6_Paragraph 2 MATCHED

	The bottom line when it comes to the Google Nest Hub and its smarter cousin, the Google Nest Hub Max, is that these devices are useful in many ways — whether you’re looking to organize your smart home, streamline home automation or get homework help from Google Assistant.
