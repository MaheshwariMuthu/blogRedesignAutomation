	New siding installation can increase the value of your home and often has a high return on investment. The ROI can vary based on the type of siding you choose. For example, fiber-cement siding offers an average of a 69.4% ROI, and vinyl siding has a 68.3% ROI, according to Remodeling Magazine. While the siding cost is high initially, you recoup a large amount of the investment with increased home value.

	Siding cost depends largely on the material you choose. Vinyl tends to be one of the cheapest siding materials, and things like stucco and wood are on the high end. You'll also find a wide range of prices within each type, which can create some overlap. For example, high-end vinyl siding can cost more than low-end wood siding. Here is a list of common siding types and their typical siding installation costs, based on pricing information from HGTV.

	$1.25 to $1.50|https://howmuch.net/costs/siding-replacement

Block4_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	The typical labor cost for siding installation is $1.25 to $1.50 (CAD 1.65 to CAD 2) per square foot, or about $2,000 to $2,400 (CAD 2,600 to CAD 3,200) total. Some types of siding cost more to install than others because the installation processes are more labor-intensive. For example, stucco is a long, multistep process. The result is that it costs a lot more to install than vinyl siding, which is relatively quick and easy to attach to your home. Labor rates can also vary by area and contractor, so check multiple quotes to compare pricing.

Heading 4: < What Are Some Other Cost Factors to Consider? > MATCHED

Block5_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	The average price ranges for different types of siding can help you estimate your siding cost, but there are several factors that can affect the pricing.

Block5_List 2 MATCHED

	Size and style of your home: Large homes require more materials, and the siding installation process takes longer, which increases labor costs. It can also cost more for a multistory house because it requires higher ladders or lifts to do the work. Complex architecture can increase the cost because it's more challenging to install the siding around those features.
Material quality: Whether you choose a high-end or low-end version of the siding material impacts your total cost.
Siding details: You can also drive up the cost of your project by choosing decorative siding with a unique texture, color or design. For example, you can get fiber cement siding that looks like wood or stucco. Those different designs tend to cost more.
Siding removal: Removing and disposing of the old siding adds to the labor costs. It's usually necessary to remove the old siding.
Repairs: If the exterior walls have damage beneath the old siding, the contractor will need to make the repairs. Paying for the labor and materials increases the project total.
Time of year: Planning your siding project during slower periods — usually fall and winter — can save you money. Contractors sometimes offer lower quotes when they're not as busy.
Additions: Your siding job might need a few extras to give your home a finished look. Examples include soffit, fascia and shutters.

Heading 5: < Ways to Save Money on Siding > MATCHED

Block6_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	Siding is an expensive home improvement project, but there are ways to save money. Try these options:

Block6_List 2 MATCHED

	Get quotes from at least three siding companies.
Choose a reputable siding contractor. Companies that aren't trustworthy might install the siding incorrectly and cause you to spend more money to fix it, or they might leave the job unfinished.
Don't pay for the entire job upfront. The contractor could skip town with your money.
Remove the old siding yourself.
Negotiate with the siding contractors to get a lower price.

Block6_Paragraph 3 MATCHED

	It's not always advisable to choose the cheapest contractor you find. If they're charging significantly less than other contractors, they might be inexperienced, or they might cut corners. Likewise, it's often better to go with a slightly higher-quality siding than the bottom option. Inexpensive materials won't hold up as well as higher-quality options that are more durable. Investing a little more now can give you more life out of the siding.
