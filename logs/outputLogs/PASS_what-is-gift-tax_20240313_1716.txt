Block1_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	Helping friends and family is a great feeling and can set your family up for success. But if you're giving substantial gifts, you need to be aware of gift taxes.

Heading 1: < What Is Gift Tax? > MATCHED

Block2_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	Gift tax is owed on money or property transferred to a person who provides little or nothing in return. Even if you don't intend a transfer to be a gift, it may still be taxed as one. For example, if you sell real estate for much less than the fair market value, the IRS may consider it a “gift.”

Heading 2: < Who Has to Pay Gift Tax? > MATCHED

Block3_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	Generally, the giver owes gift tax. Gift tax is only due once you've exceeded your allowed lifetime limit, but you still need to report large gifts on your tax return.

Block3_Paragraph 2 MATCHED

	Don't confuse gifts with winnings. Items or money won from lotteries, sweepstakes and other contests are usually taxable as the recipient's income.

Block3_Paragraph 4 MATCHED

	Under United States law, you can make annual gifts up to a limit, called the annual exclusion, before you must report the gift. The annual exclusion for 2022 is $16,000, but in past years it was less. Married couples may combine their annual limit and give up to $32,000 to a donee.

Block3_Paragraph 5 MATCHED

	Gifts to different donees are permitted. For example, if you have multiple children, you may give up to $16,000 to each child without reporting a taxable gift.

	Tax Returns and the Lifetime Exclusion Limit

Block3_Paragraph 7 MATCHED

	You must report gifts over the annual exclusion on IRS Form 709, but you probably won't have to pay any tax now. Instead, these amounts count against your lifetime exclusion limit — around $11.7 million for single taxpayers and $23.4 million for married couples.

Block3_Paragraph 8 MATCHED

	Once you exceed the lifetime exclusion, the gift tax rate varies between 18% and 40%, depending on the amount that exceeds the lifetime limit. The lifetime limit also applies to gifts made after your death, such as those made through a will, and your estate may be subject to gift taxes.

Block3_Sub Heading 9 MATCHED

	Exceptions to Taxation on Gifts

Block3_Paragraph 10 MATCHED

	Gift tax rules may not apply to gifts that are:

Block3_List 11 MATCHED

	Directly paid tuition or medical expenses
Given to a spouse
For an exempt charity
Given to a political organization

Block3_Paragraph 12 MATCHED

	Gift taxation laws are complex, so it's always smart to speak with an attorney or tax professional if you have questions.
