	Change the Filter

Block4_Paragraph 3 MATCHED

	Your HVAC filter needs to be changed or cleaned when it gets dirty. The timing can vary from once a month to once a year, depending on the filter type and your home's environment. A dusty home with pets and lots of people likely needs more frequent filter changes. Inspect your filter during your summer maintenance to see if it's ready for a change.

	Adjust Humidifier

Block4_Paragraph 11 MATCHED

	If you have a whole-house humidifier, you might need to adjust the settings or turn it off in the summer. Humidifiers are most common in the winter when the air is drier, but you might have reason to use them in the summer as well. Adjusting it to keep your home at around 40% relative humidity is ideal.
