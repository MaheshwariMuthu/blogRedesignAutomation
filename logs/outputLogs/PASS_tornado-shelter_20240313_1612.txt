Block1_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	Your home is meant to protect you and your family from the elements, but it’s not built to withstand serious natural disasters, especially where high-velocity winds are a factor. If you live in the central United States — often dubbed “Tornado Alley” — you’re probably well aware of the destruction severe weather can cause.

Block1_Paragraph 3 MATCHED

	Installing a storm shelter or safe room on your property may afford you some peace of mind. They’re designed to protect occupants from high winds and flying debris. They often have space to store emergency supplies like bottled water and nonperishable food.

Block2_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	Most tornado shelters and safe rooms cost between about $2,500 and $10,000 (CAD 3,200 and CAD 12,900), according to Bob Vila. The average homeowner spends around $6,300 (CAD 8,100).

Block3_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	Below-ground shelters provide a high level of protection from tornadoes. They may be made out of concrete or steel and are located almost entirely underground to keep occupants out of the path of wind and debris. Simple shelters built in existing basements cost an average of $3,500 (CAD 4,500), according to SFGATE. Digging out new underground space or building a custom shelter can cost up to $30,000 (CAD 38,500).

Heading 3: < Above-Ground Safe Rooms > MATCHED

Block4_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	Above-ground shelters are prebuilt, steel rooms built to withstand tornados and other types of disasters. They may be a good option for:

Block4_List 2 MATCHED

	Areas susceptible to flooding
Homes without basements
Properties where underground shelters aren’t appropriate due to limited space or high water tables
People with limited mobility

Block4_Paragraph 3 MATCHED

	Most people spend between $3,000 and $9,000 (CAD 3,850 and 11,500) on building an above-ground tornado shelter in an existing garage. However, costs can be as high as $15,000 (CAD 19,200) for other shelter types. These can be installed in any part of the home, but most people choose to install them in a garage. Above-ground shelters should be anchored to the home's foundation.

Heading 4: < Other Factors Influencing Tornado Shelter Cost > MATCHED

Block5_Sub Heading 1 MATCHED

	Materials

Block5_Paragraph 2 MATCHED

	Storm shelters must be made from tough materials, such as concrete, fiberglass, steel or Kevlar. Concrete and fiberglass tend to be cheaper, while Kevlar and steel safe rooms are more expensive.

Block5_Sub Heading 3 MATCHED

	Customization and Installation

Block5_Paragraph 4 MATCHED

	You can order a prefabricated safe room straight from a manufacturer or through a big box or hardware store. Though it's possible to install a safe room yourself, you may want to leave this job to professionals.

Block5_Paragraph 5 MATCHED

	The other option is to build a custom shelter from reinforced concrete or Kevlar. This can be an excellent way to turn an existing room or basement into a storm shelter. You'll probably want to consult with a professional to ensure your custom shelter meets local and federal safety standards.

	Size

Block5_Paragraph7_link 1 MATCHED

	FEMA|https://www.fema.gov/emergency-managers/risk-management/safe-rooms/faq

Block5_Paragraph 7 MATCHED

	The size of a shelter greatly influences how much it costs. A safe room sized to fit a family in their own home will generally cost less than a community safe room designed to hold 20 people. FEMA recommends at least 5 square feet of space per person and 10 square feet of space for wheelchair users.

Block5_Paragraph 9 MATCHED

	FEMA sets criteria for storm shelters — known as the FEMA P-361 standards — which require these spaces to be capable of withstanding 250 mph winds and flying debris.

Block5_Paragraph 10 MATCHED

	You'll want to be sure that your shelter meets FEMA standards as well as any local building codes. Meeting these requirements will protect your safety and the value of your home. A professional who handles shelter installs can make sure that these requirements are met.

Block6_Paragraph 3 MATCHED

	Installing a tornado shelter may not make sense if you live in an area that doesn't experience much extreme weather. If you live very close to a community storm shelter, you may not need your own. But many tornado-prone areas, like Oklahoma City, don't have public shelters.

Block6_Paragraph 4 MATCHED

	FEMA recommends that even people with basements consider getting a storm shelter because many houses can't withstand the force of violent storms.

Block6_Paragraph 9 MATCHED

	Storm shelters can increase the value of homes in areas that frequently experience severe weather. As with any home update, how much it boosts the value of your home depends on the quality and age of the shelter and the real estate market. In places like Oklahoma, underground tornado shelters tend to add more value to a home than above-ground safe rooms, according to the Oklahoma Journal Record.

Heading 6: < Tornado Shelter Maintenance > MATCHED

Block7_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	Like any other structure, tornado shelters require regular maintenance. Usually, this includes simple tasks like:

Block7_List 2 MATCHED

	Stocking food, water and medical supplies
Keeping the space clean and dry
Making sure the shelter and its door are in good condition

Block7_Paragraph 3 MATCHED

	A periodic professional inspection can ensure that your shelter continues to meet current safety standards. If a shelter is old or becomes damaged in a storm, it may need more extensive repairs. Some manufactured safe rooms should be replaced if they are damaged.
