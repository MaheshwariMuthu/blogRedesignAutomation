	Several Samsung smart microwaves feature power convection technology that circulates hot air evenly via a top vent. This promotes more even heating and could make the cooking process up to 30% quicker, according to the manufacturer. Some models also contain a sensor that detects the moisture in your food and automatically adjusts the settings to achieve the best possible results.

	A few options also feature a built-in air fryer, which means you won't need to find space for a separate appliance on your countertop. It’s worth mentioning that several regular Samsung microwaves also have these features, so it's important to weigh how important Wi-Fi connectivity is for you before investing in a smart microwave.

Block4_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	Most microwaves last between 9 and 10 years, according to Digital Trends, and there isn't much you can do to extend their lifespans other than keeping them clean. However, some experts are concerned that manufacturers could decide to stop releasing software updates for their smart appliances, leaving your private information vulnerable to hackers.

Block4_Paragraph 2 MATCHED

	If the manufacturer stops releasing updates, you could also find yourself in a position where the smart features on your microwave become useless. You'll still be able to use it as a microwave, but you won't be able to control it remotely from a smartphone. It's worth keeping this possibility in mind before you decide to pay the premium attached to most smart appliances.
