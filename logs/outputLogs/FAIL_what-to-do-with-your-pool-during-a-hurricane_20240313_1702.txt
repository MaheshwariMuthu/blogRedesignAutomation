Heading 2: < Should You Drain Your Pool Before a Hurricane? > MATCHED

Block3_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	One of the most common questions people ask is whether to drain a pool entirely before a hurricane. While some think this can prevent flooding, it's generally not recommended. Pools are designed to hold water, so draining them completely can lead to serious problems. Empty pools can pop out of the ground due to the lift pressure exerted by excessive groundwater. They can "float" due to the force of saturated soil, which can potentially cause structural damage, and the chance of collapse is increased because there’s no water to counterbalance external stress.
