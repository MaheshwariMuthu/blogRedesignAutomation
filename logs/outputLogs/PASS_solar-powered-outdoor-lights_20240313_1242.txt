	So, how much do solar-powered outdoor lights cost? Hereâ€™s what you need to know.

Heading 1: < What Are Solar Outdoor Lights and How Do They Work? > MATCHED

Block2_Paragraph 1 MATCHED

	Solar outdoor lights come with a solar panel that absorbs energy from natural sunlight and converts it into electricity. It stores the energy in an integrated battery and uses it to power the light when you switch it on. Therefore, you don't need wiring or an electrical supply to install solar-powered outdoor lights in your backyard.

Block2_Paragraph 2 MATCHED

	You have several options available when you're considering purchasing outdoor solar lights. One of the most popular options is solar lawn or pathway lights. These lights feature a decorative lamp on a stake that you drive into the ground along your pathway, in your lawn or into flowerbeds. They usually come in multipacks so that you can space multiple lights across a wider area.

	Alternatively, you could opt for solar string or Christmas lights. These lights are a good option if you like to decorate your house or backyard during the festive season but find yourself balking at the impact on your electrical bill. However, solar string lights aren't just for Christmas. Hanging string lights along a fence, pergola or gazebo can provide much-needed illumination and create a romantic aesthetic.

	Finally, you could consider installing solar floodlights. These lights are more powerful and are suitable for illuminating a larger area. You can get solar floodlights with timers or motion sensors to act as a security deterrent.

Block2_Paragraph 5 MATCHED

	An important factor to consider when choosing between wired or solar outdoor lights is the amount of sunlight your backyard gets throughout the year. While solar lights are a great option in areas that are sunny year-round, they may not draw enough power to function properly if you have very little sunlight in the winter. It's also essential to place solar lights in sunny areas and avoid shaded locations.

	Another area where solar outdoor lights significantly vary from regular outdoor lights is purchase and installation costs.

	Outdoor solar lights can save you significant money on your electrical bill because they draw power from natural sunlight.
