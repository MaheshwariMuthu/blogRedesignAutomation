A smart ventilation system helps you reduce your energy bills while minimizing your carbon footprint. Discover how much a smart home ventilation system costs.

The smart home revolution has changed the way we use our homes, making our essential systems more efficient and convenient. Smart home ventilation systems are among the most impactful smart home upgrades, allowing eco-friendly homeowners to tackle sky-high energy bills and indoor air quality issues. 

While there's no doubt a smart ventilation system can reduce your energy bills, it's important to consider the effect on your wallet. This guide explains why you should consider upgrading to a smart ventilation system and how much you should expect to spend.

What Is a Smart Ventilation System?
-----------------------------------

Smart vent ventilation systems are advanced climate control systems containing a smart hub, thermostat, vents and multiple sensors throughout your home. The sensors detect changes in your home throughout the day and automatically change the ventilation to support your HVAC system in cooling and heating your living space. 

Most systems include a remote control or enable control via a smartphone app, allowing you to turn the system off or adapt its settings from anywhere. However, the point of the system is to automate your home ventilation without manually adjusting the settings for changing conditions. This level of automation helps make your home more comfortable and energy-efficient, and it can also save you money on your energy bills.

How Much Do Smart Home Ventilation Systems Cost?
------------------------------------------------

As you might expect, installing a smart home ventilation system is significantly more expensive than other types of home ventilation. According to Fixr, [smart ventilation systems cost](https://www.homeserve.com/en-us/blog/cost-guide/GE-smart-range/) between $2,750 and $15,000 (CAD 3,731 and CAD 20,351) for materials and [Smart HQ app](https://www.geappliances.com/connect) installation labor. For comparison, the average cost to install a non-smart ventilation system is around $2,400 to $8,000 (CAD 3,256 to CAD 10,854).

Labor accounts for a significant portion of the cost of installing a smart air ventilation system. HVAC contractors typically charge between $1,000 and $6,000 (CAD 1,357 and CAD 8,140), or around $50 to $150 (CAD 68 to CAD 204) per hour. 

What Factors Impact the Cost of Installing a Smart Air Ventilation System?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

The size of your home can impact how much a smart home ventilation system costs. Generally, the larger your home, the bigger the system and the higher the price. Upgrading other parts of your home to optimize the system's performance could also increase your project costs. For example, you may decide to upgrade your windows to make your home more energy-efficient and boost your system's performance. 

The cost of labor in your area can also have a significant effect. As a rule, smart ventilation system installers charge more in expensive cities and suburbs than in cheaper rural areas. Expect to pay additional installation costs if your home is difficult to access, as it will make the installation process more complex.
