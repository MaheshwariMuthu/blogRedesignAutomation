Here’s an overview of how much you can expect to pay to install or replace shower doors.

Shower Door Installation Costs
------------------------------

According to [Fixr](https://www.fixr.com/costs/shower-door-installation), the total price of a shower door installation range from $900 to $2,500 (CAD 1,200 to CAD 3,200) on average, depending on the style of the door, the type you’re installing and its size.

The cost of installing a new shower door varies based on several factors, including the style of the shower door, the size and glass type. The [installation price](https://www.homedepot.com/services/c/shower-door-installation/a68d60194) also depends on whether you need a framed shower door or a frameless, pivot or slider design.

Average labor costs for glass shower door installation are around $70 (CAD 90) per hour, according to [Modernize](https://modernize.com/bathroom-remodel/shower/frameless). Frameless shower door installation by a professional can cost [$300 to $400](https://porch.com/project-cost/cost-to-install-a-glass-shower-door) (CAD 390 to CAD 515) or more. For sliding door shower installation by a pro, typical costs are roughly $100 (CAD 130).

Whether you’re changing out your shower door because you need a replacement or you want to enhance your bathroom with luxurious spa-like surroundings, making sure you install your shower door properly and safely is key.

Types of Shower Doors
---------------------

Many options, including glass shower doors, can transform your shower and the overall look of your bathroom. Depending on what kind of style you choose or how much money you want to spend, you can create a private space to enjoy steamy, luxurious showers.

### Frameless Shower Door

This type of enclosure relies on sturdy 1/2-inch tempered glass that doesn’t use metal supports around the exterior edges. This popular modern look is designed to put the focus on the shower walls and features. Frameless shower doors typically cost twice as much as a basic shower door model, sometimes as high as [$2,900](https://www.fixr.com/costs/shower-door-installation) (CAD 3,800) installed.

### Semi-Frameless Shower Door

If the complete frameless look is out of your budget, a semi-frameless shower door is a great alternative. This type of shower door is made with 3/8-inch tempered glass and looks sleek and contemporary. Prices typically range from $890 to $1,200 (CAD 1,150 to CAD 1,550), depending on the brand, size and overall style.

### Framed Shower Door

Framed shower doors are made of sturdy aluminum framing and come in a variety of appealing finishes to match your bathroom decor. Prices range from $600 to $1,800 (CAD 775 to CAD 2,300), including installation.

### Glass Tub Shower Door

If you want to upgrade from a plastic shower curtain but can’t quite afford the frameless shower door option, a glass tub shower door might be a good choice. It's made with 3/8-inch-thick glass and rolls easily over a stainless-steel track bar. Glass tub shower doors cost between $680 and $925 (CAD 880 and CAD 1,200), according to [Porch](https://porch.com/project-cost/cost-to-install-a-bathtub-door).

### Sliding Shower Door

Also known as bypass doors, sliding shower doors are a practical option designed for narrow bathrooms and are priced as low as [$275](https://www.costimates.com/costs/bathrooms/glass-shower-doors/) (CAD 350) if you install them yourself, or $750 (CAD 970) if installed by a professional.

DIY Shower Door Installation
----------------------------

If you go the do-it-yourself route and install your own shower door, there’s a good chance you already have the basic tools on hand. Naturally, the first and most important thing you need is the shower door, which you can pick out at any home improvement store or online. You’ll also need the following:

*   Hammer
*   Level
*   Tape measure
*   Caulk gun
*   Plastic mallet
*   Drill/driver
*   Hacksaw
*   Utility knife
*   Stainless steel screws

Can a New Shower Door Add Value to a Home?
------------------------------------------

Whether you’re going for the modern look, sleek detail or minimalist design, adding a glass shower enclosure opens up your bathroom space, making it feel more inviting and appear larger. And it can even improve the functionality of your shower.

Replacing your old plastic shower curtain with a new frameless glass shower door can add light to your lather-and-rinse space. But don’t convert your bathroom into a luxury spa solely for the sake of drawing in potential buyers if you’re looking to sell anytime soon.

A shower door replacement won’t provide a high enough return on investment to justify the expense, but if you install a new shower door and _then_ find yourself selling your home, it’s definitely a feature that new owners would potentially appreciate.

How Long Does It Take to Install a Shower Door?
-----------------------------------------------

The length of time it takes to receive your shower door and have it installed depends on your style and features. If you order a customized shower door that fits in your specific space, it might need to be fabricated and delivered. It can take up to three weeks from the time you place your order until it arrives, but the actual installation typically takes a professional contractor a few hours to complete.  Some contractors may suggest you wait 24 hours after installation before showering again.

Why Is Shower Glass So Expensive?
---------------------------------

Glass shower doors can be pricey, depending on the [type of glass and style of door](https://www.thespruce.com/types-of-shower-doors-2719001). Fogged, etched or clear are the three main types of shower glass, and the one you select is going to dictate the price. There are a variety of door designs, hinge configurations and hardware finishes to choose from, as well.

The standard thickness for glass shower door panels is 3/8 inch, but you can upgrade to 1/2-inch glass, if you'd like, which provides the benefits of extra thickness and stability. Keep in mind that 1/2-inch glass is also heavier, which means it likely costs more overall, since there are extra steps involved with manufacturing and shipping.

Pro or DIY Installation?
------------------------

You can go the DIY route and install your shower door by yourself — or hire a professional contractor to handle the job for you. They may even be able to unclog the shower drain while they're there. Installing a shower door on your own may be manageable, but even an experienced professional contractor can run into trouble sometimes. While the DIY route might save you money, hiring a pro will save you time and give you peace of mind that the job is done correctly and safely.<br><iframe title="YouTube video player" width="1072" height="603" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pM2NlhbKBH0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen title="How to Drain A Water Heater | Hot Water Tank Tips"></iframe>
