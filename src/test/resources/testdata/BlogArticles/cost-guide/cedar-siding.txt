  What's not to like about cedar siding? It's durable and eye-catching, with natural tones that blend beautifully with the surrounding environment. Innately infused with oils that reduce weathering, cedar is a natural insulator, which means it helps you lower your energy bills and boost your home's curb appeal.

The look is one thing, but the cost is another. Here’s what you need to know if you’re looking to side your house with cedar.

Cedar Shingles Vs. Cedar Shake Siding
-------------------------------------

Many people think cedar shingles for siding are the same as cedar shake, but the two are quite different. Shingle is typically thinner, tapered and cut on both sides by a vertical saw. Shakes are more commonly made by hand and split on one or both sides, so no two are identical. Other key differences include the following.

### Cedar Shingle Siding

*   A smooth, uniform look
*   Slim appearance
*   Can last 20 to 40 years if well-maintained

### Cedar Shake Siding

*   Cutting method creates a more rustic appearance
*   Thicker than shingle
*   Typically lasts longer than shingle

Cedar Shake Siding Costs
------------------------

You should expect to pay [$6 to $8](https://howmuch.net/costs/cedar-siding-install) (CAD 8 to CAD 10.50) per square foot for cedar shake siding. This equates to around $9,600 to $12,800 (CAD 12,500 to CAD 16,700) for a 1,600-square-foot home, which is the average size of a single-family home.

Cedar Shingles Costs
--------------------

Cedar shingles cost the same as cedar shake siding when compared by the foot — $6 to $8 (CAD 8 to CAD 10.50) per square foot.

Installation Costs
------------------

The quality of the materials, surface area covered and necessary preparation work will all influence installation costs. On average, you can expect to pay around [$4](https://howmuch.net/costs/cedar-siding-install) (CAD 5) per square foot for installation.

Siding Removal
--------------

You will likely need to remove the home's existing siding before installation, which typically costs around [$2](https://howmuch.net/costs/cedar-siding-install) (CAD 2.50) per square foot. It is sometimes possible to fit new onto old, although it's rarely recommended, particularly if the original siding is warped or rotting.

Alternatives to Cedar Siding
----------------------------

If you're not completely set on cedar siding, you may want to consider other materials. Those listed here have varying levels of curb appeal, maintenance requirements and costs.

* **Hardie Board:** Hardie Board siding is made from Portland cement, sand and cellulose fibers, which makes it flexible enough to either look contemporary or mimic the countrified style of cedar shake siding, but the difference is noticeable. It usually comes with a 30-year warranty and is typically more affordable than cedar siding.
* **Vinyl:** Vinyl is an inexpensive, low-maintenance alternative to cedar siding that also doesn't require painting, which lowers costs. However, it's usually better to have a contractor do the fitting because poorly installed vinyl siding is prone to warping and cracking. It also ages faster, showing signs of deterioration even 10 years after the installation, depending on the local climate.
* **Stucco:** Properly fitted and maintained, stucco siding can outlast other options already covered. It's applied wet and left to harden, creating a solid barrier between the climate and the home's more vulnerable materials and is flexible enough to create smooth or textured finishes. Materials are usually inexpensive when compared to cedar siding costs, but labor may be costlier.<br><iframe title="YouTube video player" width="1072" height="603" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/reJaChMAC_w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
