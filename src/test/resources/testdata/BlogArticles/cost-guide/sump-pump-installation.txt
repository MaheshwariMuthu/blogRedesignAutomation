Sump pump replacement costs depend on many factors, such as the pump material, size and horsepower. It’s important that you get any sump pump issues sorted sooner rather than later, considering how essential a home sump pump is to any property’s plumbing setup.

Sump Pump Basics
----------------

A sump pump is a submersible drainage pump hooked up to the sump pit, which is the in-ground pit that collects drain water. A sump pit is typically located in the basement, and it's used to collect both natural groundwater and water from drains throughout the home and property. A sump pump works by pumping the pit water out away from the home to keep the basement and crawlspace dry.

Sump pumps come in different sizes depending on the required capacity and weather in your area. Keep in mind that a rainy day brings an average of about 20 inches or gallons of water per minute into the basement sump pit. You can estimate how much water is received per hour of rainfall to establish the necessary pumping capacity and the required size of your sump pump.

Sump Pump Maintenance
---------------------

When you follow the right maintenance routine, a sump pump should last for about 10 years. According to [LawnStarter](https://www.lawnstarter.com/blog/cost/sump-pump-installation-price/), having a new sump pump installed can cost anywhere from $290 to $4,740 (CAD 400 to CAD 6,500), although the average cost falls right around $1,160 (CAD 1,600). If you notice signs that your sump pump is going out — such as strange noises, excessive vibration or obvious rust — you may need to be prepared to cover the sump pump replacement cost.

Average Sump Pump Replacement Cost
----------------------------------

It’s helpful to understand the difference between the cost of replacing a sump pump and that of installing a new sump pump. Generally, as with many components in your home, it’s cheaper to replace an existing unit than to install an entirely new one. That’s because the reservoir is already dug and the drainage is in place, so there are lower labor costs and less time involved. Standard sump pump replacement by a professional team usually costs between $490 and $1,170 (CAD 675 and CAD 1,600), according to data from [HomeGuide](https://homeguide.com/costs/sump-pump-installation-cost), though the price goes up if you’re adding backup batteries or extra capacity.

Average Sump Pump Installation Cost
-----------------------------------

In terms of the cost to replace a sump pump or install a new sump pump, you can expect to pay more for an entirely new installation. This project requires more prep work to make way for the sump pump and, of course, time equals money in the home service industry.

These sump pump installation components can give you a better idea of what’s to come with new sump pump installation:

* **Sump crock hole:** A concrete saw is used to cut a hole before the sump crock placement.
* **Sump crock installation:** The crock connects to the drain tile to collect surplus water. It’s best to get a sump crock with a sealable top to keep radon gas from filtering into your home.
* **Submersible pump installation:** The watertight pump is sealed and submerged to pump water efficiently away from the basement or crawlspace.
* **Exit pipe preparation:** All water in the crock needs to be pumped through an exit pipe leaving the home. This is usually set up through a hole in the foundation wall, so the installation team will need to bore a hole before the rest of the work can continue.
* **Outside dry crock dig:** Contractors typically find a spot 6 to 12 feet outside the foundation and fill it with drain stone and sand.
* **Electrical connection:** If there’s no outlet nearby for connecting the sump pump, one must be installed before the sump pump can be safely plugged in.

Your submersible-sump-pump provider will likely give you an estimate that includes all these costs. The size and condition of your property may also play a role in how easy or difficult it is for contractors to complete these tasks.

Sump Pump Types
---------------

To break it down even further, the sump pump cost varies by type. Different types include:

*   Regular sump pumps
*   Sewage pumps
*   Combination pumps
*   Battery backup pumps
*   Battery-powered pumps
*   Water-powered pumps

The more expensive sump pumps include water-powered varieties, as well as sewage pumps, which can surpass $500 (CAD 690) on the pricier end for the pump alone. If a sump pump relies on water to operate, it takes more time and energy to produce the same results as a battery-powered option. Plus, battery-powered pumps don’t waste as much water.

The price may change depending on whether you choose a submersible or pedestal sump pump. While a submersible pump is quieter, thanks to the muffling feature, this strong pump brings a higher risk of flooding as well as pricier repairs. Homeowners can expect to see $60 to $420 (CAD 85 to CAD 580) as a typical price range for submersible pumps, compared with a more budget-friendly range of $60 to $170 (CAD 85 to CAD 235) for pedestal pumps featuring a motor and hose. Pedestal sump pumps use moderate power, and although they’re more likely to clog, they’re also easier to fix.

How Much Does It Cost to Have a New Sump Pump Installed?
--------------------------------------------------------

According to [Fixr](https://www.fixr.com/costs/sump-pump-installation#sump-pump-cost-by-motor-horsepower), buying a 1/3-horsepower pump can be as cheap as $90 (CAD 125), while a 1-horsepower pump costs around $200 to $800 (CAD 275 to CAD 1,100). Your sump pump contractor can give you a good idea of what your home requires and what makes the most sense for your budget.

The sump pump check valve works hard to pump all the water out as soon as possible, and the higher quality pump you have, the better. Some homeowners go for the lower sump pump installation cost and compromise a bit on horsepower, while those who have experienced significant flooding or live in a wet region often benefit from the added capacity.

### Sump Pump Brands

Another point of difference in sump pump costs is the brand. Some manufacturers are more expensive than others, which is why you need to do adequate research and consult your contractor for their opinion on what’s worth the extra money and what’s not.

Some of the most popular sump pump brands include:

*   Basement Watchdog
*   Deco
*   Flotec
*   Liberty Pumps
*   Professional EZ Travel Collection
*   Superior
*   WaterAce
*   Wayne
*   Zoeller

The price of sump pump replacement and installation varies by material, as well. Pumps can be made from cast iron, aluminum or plastic. When looking at the prices of sump pumps by material, you’ll find that sump pumps made of cast iron are more expensive than plastic models. You can find a balance between quality and budget if you scope out a few options and ask for recommendations or browse online for the most popular models.

Settling on a sump pump cost that makes sense for your budget and your home requirements is the best path for protecting your home while also making smart financial decisions for your property.

New Sump Pump Replacement
-------------------------

If your current sump pump has reached the end of its lifespan and you need to arrange for a replacement, you can get itemized sump pump replacement costs from a trusted contractor near you. This estimate should include the following costs:

* **The condition of your sump pump system.** This includes the sump pit and drainage pipes. If everything else is in fine working order, you’ll have lower repair and replacement costs to worry about.
* **The size of the exterior crock**. If the crock has properly accommodated your sump pump and you don’t need to make any changes, then you can save on material and labor costs. If your sump pump runs often and you need a larger crock, then the replacement may cost more.
* **The sump pump capacity**. If you need to make changes to the pipe height or overall capacity, there may be additional costs associated with the replacement.
* **Contractor tools**. It’s best if you hire a sump pump contractor who has their own machines, but if they don’t own a cutter or drill, they may need a rental that could up the price of your job.
* **Electricity and battery backups**. Adding a more suitable electrical outlet could cost an extra $80 to $200 (CAD 110 to CAD 275), according to [HomeGuide](https://homeguide.com/costs/cost-to-replace-an-outlet), while installing an optional backup battery system usually tacks on $150 to $2,000 (CAD 200 to CAD 2,750). You may also find a sump pump with an integrated backup solution, which is often a smart choice, especially if you’ve dealt with basement flooding before.

You could pay towards the lower end of the scale if you already have the necessary infrastructure to support your replacement sump pump. The more upgrades you need to make, the closer your project will cost to the average maximum of $1,170 (CAD 1,600).

Sump Pump Labor Costs
---------------------

You also need to remember that the labor costs to install or replace a sump pump will have an impact on your total bill. If the job is relatively straightforward, with only minor digging and prep work, then the final price tag may be on the more affordable end of the spectrum. If your contractor needs to do a complete overhaul of your property to get the sump pit and sump pump in place, then you’ll be looking at a lot more money and time. Many contractors charge per hour of work, and they could give you a time estimate to help you set your budget for this project. If they encounter hidden problems that tack on time and work, this could increase the cost of your sump pump improvements.

What Size Sump Pump Do I Need?
------------------------------

The overall cost of your replacement or installation project will be influenced by the sump pump size: How far are you pumping, and how high are you pumping? To avoid drainage problems and get the most for your money, you need to ensure the sump pump fits seamlessly into the sump pit and plumbing system. With adequate capacity and motor power, your new sump pump will clear out water quickly and keep your home dry and free of moist conditions, water damage and mold growth.

Other Sump Pump Priorities
--------------------------

Having a durable sump pit and sump pump system that removes water effectively can prevent the stress and damage of a flooded basement. Avoiding water damage is much simpler with the right sump pump and discharge pipe. Some of the other cost factors to meet your drainage requirements include:

*   The likelihood of [power outages](https://www.familyhandyman.com/project/sump-pump-backup/) and floods in your area
*   The setup and design of your basement and crawlspace
*   Your preference for an automatic or manual switching system

How Many Years Does a Sump Pump Last?
-------------------------------------

If you take good care of your sump pump and your overall plumbing system with regular maintenance, you can potentially have a basement sump pump continue working for 10 to 15 years. The motor in pedestal sump pumps can even make it for 20 to 25 years when cleaned properly on a routine basis.

Even if you have a battery backup, thorough sump pump maintenance is necessary to keep all components, including the check valve and motor, working at the highest level and capacity. The costs of installing a sump pump can quickly add up, and if you can avoid sump pump replacement for at least a decade, it will benefit your home improvement budget and leave room for other project costs.
