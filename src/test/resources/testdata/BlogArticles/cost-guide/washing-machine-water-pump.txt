  You put a load of laundry in and come back later to switch the laundry to the dryer, only to discover your laundry room floor is covered in water.

One of the most common causes of a washer leaking is the washing machine water pump going bad.

What Happens to Your Washer When the Water Pump Breaks?
-------------------------------------------------------

The washing machine pump is responsible for draining the water out of the washing machine tub between cycles. When it breaks, you may notice issues such as:

*   Standing water in the tub when the washer has completed a cycle
*   Water leaking out onto the floor from the bottom of the machine
*   The washer stopping or starting cycles at odd times, as a broken water pump can cause issues with the water level sensors that control automatic cycles
*   Strange noises, such as a loud humming, which could indicate the pump is trying to work but failing
*   Clothes that are wetter than usual at the end of a cycle

What signs you notice could vary depending on whether the water pump is still partially functional or if it breaks and stops working entirely. You can also test to see if the issue is the pump by filling the washer and attempting to run a drain cycle without laundry.

How Much Does a New Water Pump Cost?
------------------------------------

How much it costs to fix a bad washing machine water pump can depend on the brand of washer. Generally, higher-end brands are more expensive when it comes to parts, but it's always important to check the warranty to determine if the cost for the part — and even labor — may be covered. On average, the washer pump replacement cost is between $20 and $100 (CAD 27 to CAD 134) just for the part itself, according to data from [HomeGuide](https://homeguide.com/costs/washing-machine-repair-cost).

How Much Does It Cost to Have a Washer Water Pump Repaired by a Pro?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

If you're not confident about your DIY skills, you may want to hire a professional to handle fixing the water pump for a washer. However, if you hire a professional, you'll pay more for the repair because you'll also need to factor in labor costs. Labor costs can range from $50 to $200 (CAD 67 to 268) and are generally charged by the hour or job. This makes the total average cost to replace a washing machine water pump between $150 and $350 (CAD 201 and CAD 469).

Can You Fix It Yourself?
------------------------

It's possible to fix a washing machine water pump yourself if you have some basic tools. First, you'll need to determine what part you need, which can be done by searching for the make and model online or by contacting the manufacturer. The exact procedure to replace the pump can vary by machine, but in general, you'll need to unplug the washer and take off the face. Then, you can remove the pump and replace it with the new part. Put the face of the washer back on, reconnect the power and run a drain cycle to see if it works properly.
