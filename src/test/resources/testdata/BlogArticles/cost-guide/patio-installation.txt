Installing a patio creates an instant outdoor living, lounging and entertainment space — but how much will it cost? The price of patio installation varies widely based on factors such as how big you want your patio to be, the material you want to build it from and whether you install the patio yourself or hire someone to install it for you.

An estimate from a contractor will give you the best idea of what your particular project will cost. Use this overview of patio installation costs as a cheat sheet to help you plan your budget.

Patio Costs Per Square Foot
---------------------------

Most patios are made by laying pavers, the cheapest of which are red or grey brick pavers. According to [Fixr](https://www.fixr.com/costs/build-patio#cost-to-build-a-paver-patio), these cost between $10 and $25 (CAD 13 and CAD 33) per square foot, including materials and installation.

Dry-laid brick, which is made using concrete, natural stone or brick pavers held together with dry sand, costs $12 to $20 (CAD 15 to CAD 25) per square foot.

Using natural stone, slate, flagstone or bluestone to create your patio is significantly more expensive because of the high cost of materials. Prices vary, but you should expect to pay up to $30 (CAD 40) per square foot.

Poured concrete patios cost $6 to $17 (CAD 8 to CAD 22) per square foot. For the full installation, [LawnStarter](https://www.lawnstarter.com/blog/cost/concrete-patio-price/) says you might pay about $1,500 (CAD 1,950) on the low end, and over $4,700 (CAD 6,100) on the high end, depending on the size of the patio.

Labor Costs
-----------

Labor costs can dramatically increase the cost of your patio project. Expect to pay a contractor between $5 and $10 (CAD 6 and CAD 13) per square foot to install a paver patio. However, you could pay as much as $25 (CAD 33) per square foot for complex installation methods such as stamped concrete. Plan on paying for 40 hours of labor for every 300 square feet of patio.

How Much Does a 20x20 Paver Patio Cost?
---------------------------------------

According to data from [Lawnstarter](https://www.lawnstarter.com/blog/cost/paver-patio-price/#2-cost-estimator-by-size), a 20-foot by 20-foot paver patio runs from about $3,500 to $8,900 (CAD 4,550 to CAD 11,600), including labor and materials such as clay brick, natural stone or concrete pavers. Obviously, the larger the patio, the more materials required and the greater the labor costs.

How Much Does a 20x20 Concrete Patio Cost?
------------------------------------------

How much it costs to install a concrete patio depends on various factors, including the concrete grade and finish. It usually costs between $1,750 and $6,400 (CAD 2,275 and CAD 8,300) to install a 20-foot by 20-foot concrete patio.

Additional Patio Costs
----------------------

Beyond labor and the cost of materials, there are other price factors to consider when thinking about a patio installation. For instance, you may need to install a new door to access the patio. Installing the patio may also require putting in a retaining wall. Those costs should be factored into your budget. If trees, bushes or shrubs must be removed for the installation, this can tack on additional costs to your project’s total. Also, factor in the cost of upgrades such as an outdoor ceiling fan, new patio furniture or an outdoor kitchen.

DIY Patio Installation
----------------------

Got DIY know-how and patience? Willing to go for an uncomplicated patio design? Do you have or could you rent the equipment necessary? If so, you can have a huge impact on the cost of your patio installation by doing it yourself. To tackle this DIY project, you’ll need to know how to operate the tools needed for the job, possess the ability to cut and measure and have time on your hands to get the job done. If this sounds like you, shake the dust off those tools in the shed and save a huge chunk of change by making your patio a DIY project.

Deck Vs. Patio
--------------

On the fence about whether to build a patio or a deck? Keep in mind that patios generally afford more privacy than decks, and they usually cost less. Patio materials are less expensive, and installation requires less time and labor.

Is a Patio Worth the Money?
