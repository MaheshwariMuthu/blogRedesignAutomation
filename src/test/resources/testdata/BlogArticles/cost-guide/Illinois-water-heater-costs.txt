  Hot showers are a must for most folks any time of the year — but if you’ve ever experienced an Illinois winter, with the wind charging across the Prairie state like a herd of bison stampeding in the frontier days, then you know you don’t want to find out what it’s like to go without a water heater, here. Well take heart, Land of Lincoln dwellers, because from the part of the state that roots for the Chicago Cubs all the way downstate to where they claim those St. Louis Cardinals across the river in Missouri, the average Illinoisan pays _less_ for water heater repairs or replacements than the Americans at large.

Your water heater powers your dishwasher, clothes washer and the hot shower you crave at the end of the day. When it goes kaput, it's not so much a matter of _whether_ you should have it serviced, but how much that service will cost. And if your hot water is already out, the last thing you want right now is to be blindsided by exorbitant water heater service fees. If you’re calling around for estimates, these figures should give you a ballpark idea of how much you can expect to pay in Illinois.

Repair and replacement costs vary depending on where you live. For comparison, the national average for diagnosis is $99, for repair is $493 and for replacement is $1,741.

The following average prices are based on aggregated HomeServe data reported by our network of contractors across the state of Illinois:

Water Heater Diagnosis: $87
---------------------------

The technician will charge you a fee to come out to your home, tell you what’s wrong with your system and determine whether it needs to be repaired or replaced. For Illinoisans in general‚ this fee is about 12% lower than the national average.

Water Heater Repair: $357
-------------------------

Any number of things may be going wrong with your water heater — issues with the gas control valve, a faulty thermostat or a combination of several malfunctions. This average repair price includes replacement parts and the labor to install them. Water heater repairs in Illinois cost about 28% less than they do nationwide.

Water Heater Replace: $1,452
----------------------------

Water heaters don’t last forever, and a breakdown might be a sign that yours is on its way out. At the end of your water heater’s usable life (about 10 years), you'll need to spring for a new one. Illinois’ average replacement price is about 17% less than that of the nation.

(Note that HomeServe water heater data should generally be assumed to refer to conventional “tanked” models — the most common type — as opposed to tankless or “on-demand” models, which can cost roughly twice as much.)
