  Few things are better than pulling into your driveway after a long day away from home. That is, of course, if you have a professionally installed concrete driveway that matches your home's needs and your preferences. Concrete driveways can be expensive; however, the reduced maintenance costs and higher curb appeal mean they provide a positive return on investment.

Due to the special tools, equipment and cost to pour concrete, installing a concrete driveway isn't a job you want to DIY. Instead, hire qualified concrete driveway contractors who can assist with everything from installation to maintenance. Costs can vary significantly based on the types of materials involved, labor costs and customization.

How Much Does It Cost to Have a Concrete Driveway Installed?
------------------------------------------------------------

The total average cost for a concrete driveway is $1,600 to 6,400 (CAD 2,175 to CAD 8,700), according to [HomeGuide](https://homeguide.com/costs/concrete-driveway-cost). This can vary significantly based on the size and type of concrete driveway being installed.

How Much Do Materials Cost?
---------------------------

The typical rate is $4 to $8 (CAD 5.44 to CAD 10.87) per square foot of concrete, although you could pay up to $18 (CAD 24) per square foot for decorative concrete finishes. The cost of materials needed to install a concrete driveway depends on the type and amount of concrete mix used for the project. The concrete mix should have a minimum of 4,000 psi compressive strength. It should also have a water-to-cement ratio of 0.50, per [Concrete Questions](https://concretequestions.com/what-concrete-mix-to-use-for-a-driveway/).

How Much Does Labor Cost?
-------------------------

You'll likely be relying on contractors to handle your concrete driveway installation, so labor costs will vary based on their availability, project scope and other factors. Labor costs also depend on if an existing driveway needs to be removed before a new one can be installed. Typical rates for contractors can range between $2 and $4 (CAD 2.72 and CAD 5.44) per square foot.

It's important to obtain multiple quotes for any driveway installation project. A reputable contractor will conduct an on-site visit to assess your property and determine the needs of the project. Some contractors may charge for this consultation, which could increase the overall cost of labor for the driveway installation.

Factors That Can Influence the Overall Cost
-------------------------------------------

No two concrete driveways are alike, so there are many factors that can change the total project price. Concrete driveways can range from very basic to quite elaborate. For example, a heated driveway will increase costs, but it’ll also increase the overall value of your home. Likewise, stamped concrete can add a custom, appealing flair to your driveway.

Concrete does come with maintenance costs, but these are typically much lower than other types of pavement, such as asphalt, which requires resealing every few years.

How Much Does It Cost to Repair a Concrete Driveway?
----------------------------------------------------

Keeping your driveway in proper working order should be a priority for you as a homeowner. It boosts the curb appeal of your property and keeps your vehicles safe from damage due to a faulty driveway. Depending on the type and severity of the damage, it can cost anywhere from several hundred to several thousand dollars to repair a concrete driveway. The average cost of fixing a concrete driveway is $175 to $3,600 (CAD 238 to CAD 4,894), according to [Today's Homeowner](https://todayshomeowner.com/concrete/cost/concrete-driveway-repair-cost/).
