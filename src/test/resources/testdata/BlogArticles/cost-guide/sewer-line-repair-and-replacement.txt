  Are you noticing a gurgling noise and smelling an unpleasant odor when you’re in the bathroom (neither of which is coming from _you_)? You may have a compromised sanitary sewer line — and, it goes without saying, but that’s _not_ the sort of repair you want to procrastinate on.

**This May Also Interest You:** [**How Much Does It Cost to Repair or Replace a Water Service Line?**](https://www.homeserve.com/en-us/blog/cost-guide/main-water-line-repair-versus-replacement/)

Your sewer line is distinct (or, should we say, _di-stinked_?) from your water service line, which carries fresh water _to_ your house, and storm sewer, which channels rainwater away from your house. As defined by [Michigan State University](http://msu-water.msu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Storm-vs.pdf): “The sanitary sewer is a system of underground pipes that carries sewage from bathrooms, sinks, kitchens, and other plumbing components to a wastewater treatment plant where it is filtered, treated and discharged.”

These pipes can leak over time if proper maintenance isn’t performed — and even when it is. According to [The Eco Plumbers](https://www.ecoplumbers.com/2017/11/27/how-often-should-your-sewer-lines-be-cleaned/) of Ohio, homeowners should have their sewer pipes serviced at least every few years, and for large households with several residents creating a lot of sewage waste, at least every two years. This will ensure your sanitary sewer line remains free of clogs and potential backups from debris building up over time.

But even if you keep your line well-maintained, ground shifting, pipe separations, cracks, root infiltrations and other issues can cause unsanitary leaks in your sanitary sewer system. Signs of trouble can include the aforementioned gurgling toilet and accompanying stench, slow draining, puddles of sewer water in your yard — and even a peculiarly robust patch of green grass that's been fertilized by the sewage.

Once you’ve identified a potential sewer-line leak, you’re going to need to call in the pros post-haste to stop this gross waste. We at HomeServe advocate for homeowners to do their own maintenance and repairs wherever they are willing, able and confident to do so, but this isn’t the type of job the vast majority of people can handle themselves without proper training, expertise, equipment and safety precautions. That means you’re going to want to have at least an idea of how much a repair job is likely to cost you _before_ you start making panicked calls to sewer contractors.

What Impacts the Cost of a Sewer Repair?
----------------------------------------

Project costs vary wildly depending on a number of variables. Factors influencing the cost of a sewer repair can include:

*   The type of pipe (it could be PVC, concrete, cast iron, clay or other materials)
*   How the line is inspected
*   Whether the pipe must be replaced or can simply be patched
*   Whether excavation work is required
*   Pipe depth
*   The type and state of the soil
*   The region and terrain
*   Whether additional cleanup work required

If the damage to your sewer line is relatively minor, you may be able to fix the issue with a trenchless repair. This method involves breaking the pipe, removing it and sliding a new one into place, and can also be done by installing and inflating a new lining within the existing pipe. If tree roots must be removed from the sewer lines or if the pipe is, for example, under a concrete slab, sidewalk, curb, driveway or landscaping that must be torn up to access the pipe, costs may be hundreds of dollars per foot higher than for a trenchless repair.

Pro tip: Have a sewer camera inspection performed before committing to any work. Because there are so many factors to take into consideration, this will help better determine the scope of work needed.

OK, What’s the Damage?
----------------------

To give you an idea of what you can expect to pay for sanitary sewer line maintenance (i.e., cleaning and clog prevention) or repair, HomeServe has calculated the average costs — both nationally and state by state — for comparison. In order to determine what’s wrong with your system, you’ll have to call someone out to diagnose the problem, which comes with its own cost. We’ve calculated that average, as well.

Below, you’ll find the average costs for sanitary sewer line maintenance and repair in your state. All figures are based on aggregated HomeServe data reported by our network of thousands of contractors across the nation. Where insufficient data was available to determine a verifiable average, we’ve noted so.

(At the time of publication, pandemic-precipitated materials shortages were impacting home maintenance, repair and construction sectors across the board; price fluctuations caused by those supply-chain issues are not necessarily reflected here.)
