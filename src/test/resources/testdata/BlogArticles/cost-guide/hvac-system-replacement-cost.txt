However, after some time, you'll have to replace even the best equipment on the market. When that time comes, it’s helpful to have some knowledge about the average cost of HVAC installation.

Determining HVAC Installation Costs
-----------------------------------

A definitive HVAC replacement cost estimate is hard to calculate. The final price depends on the size of your home and the type of equipment you choose. If your equipment isn't compatible with your home, it may be either overexerted or overpowered. In both cases, the machine may have a shorter lifespan. One of your first steps will be to have an expert HVAC technician come to your home and measure your heating and cooling needs. According to [Lawnstarter](https://www.lawnstarter.com/blog/cost/hvac-repair-price/), it costs between $60 and $150 (CAD 82 and CAD 205) to call out an HVAC technician.

The cost of a new [air conditioning unit](https://www.lawnstarter.com/blog/cost/ac-unit-price/#:~:text=Average%20Costs%20to%20Install%20an%20AC%20Unit%20in%202023&text=A%20basic%20air%20conditioner%20costs,up%20to%20%2414%2C000%20in%20total.) ranges from $3,500 to $8,000 (CAD 4,778 to CAD 10,922), while a gas furnace costs between $700 and $10,700 (CAD 956 and CAD 14,608). The difference in pricing is often a matter of power and efficiency. High-efficiency units usually cost more upfront, but they're less expensive to operate over time. Larger homes need more heating or cooling power, and more powerful units are on the expensive end of the scale.

You also have to consider the cost of labor when you install or replace your home systems. [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/home-improvement/hvac/new-hvac-system-cost/) says the labor to install or replace HVAC systems costs between $500 and $2,500 (CAD 683 and CAD 3,413) on average, with hourly rates ranging between $60 and $150 (CAD 82 and CAD 205) per hour. However, if your situation is more complex, the costs will increase. For example, if the contractor must install ductwork for a central heating and cooling system, it will add to the price.

This extra work will also add to the time of the project. In most cases, a well-organized company can perform a furnace or AC replacement in a single day. When there's extra ductwork needed or other additions involved, your house may be tied up for a week.

How to Find the Right Professional
----------------------------------

HVAC installation and maintenance require several years of training. Unless you're a skilled HVAC technician, you shouldn’t think about trying to do this project on your own. However, this means you'll have to find an HVAC professional you can trust.

In addition to cost, there are some easy ways to find the right company for the job. Everyone who has a home has some kind of home comfort system. You can talk to people around you about their experiences with local professionals. These days, there are also many resources online that provide reviews.

At a basic level, you want to work with someone who is fully licensed, bonded and insured. Experience matters when it comes to your home. Most HVAC pros list how long they've been in business on their websites.

To find the best prices, get at least three estimates from different HVAC companies in your area. This way, you can be sure that you’re getting the best deal.

You also should look for a company that offers great customer service. Ideally, the company that installs your home systems will be the one that maintains them. If the business was slow to respond to your calls or impatient with your questions, it might not be the team you want working on your home.

Additional HVAC Replacement Costs
---------------------------------

You can run into unexpected costs in your HVAC system replacement project. The process can get complex, especially if you're installing a new system. Depending on the scope of the project, you may need to obtain building permits. The price of a permit varies from town to town, but [HomeGuide](https://homeguide.com/costs/building-permit-cost) says it can cost anywhere from $50 to $1,500 (CAD 68 to CAD 2,048).

If you have a historic home, you may experience the cost of working through the additional legal hurdles involved. Older homes can also have unusual spaces that require custom ductwork and creative installation solutions. Extra work can mean extra expenses.
