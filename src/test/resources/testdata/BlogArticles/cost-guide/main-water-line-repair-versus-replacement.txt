Your water service line is the underground pipe that carries water from the public water main into your home and out of your faucets and other fixtures. When something goes wrong — whether it be aging pipes, invading tree roots or digging in the wrong spot — all that water can end up flooding your yard and damaging your home.

A common misconception is that someone else will pay for those repairs. However, that’s not usually the case. _You_ are likely responsible for repairing or replacing _your_ water service line should it break. Think of the system as having three main components: the water distribution main, the private service line and the public service line.

**<img class="detail-image" src="/en-us/assets/images/blog/cost-guide/Blog-WSL_cross-section_EROSSI_Article.jpg" alt="graphic visualization showing a cut-away of a home exposing its rooms and home systems specifically focused on the water service line"/>**

The Bucks _Start_ Here...
-------------------------

The water distribution main is the community water supply. It’s owned by the municipality and brings water within range of your home, usually by running under the street in front of your house. Water enters your home through your private water service line, which connects to the distribution main and runs under your property to your water meter and main shutoff valve.

When something goes wrong with your private water service line, you’re on the hook for repairs. Depending on your municipality, there may also be a public portion of the service line, which is buried under city land, like a sidewalk. As soon as the pipe runs under your property line, however, it’s _your_ responsibility.

Deeper Ain’t Cheaper
--------------------

Water service lines are buried as deep as local building codes require — but usually the depth is determined by the frost line in your area. The frost line is the level to which the soil typically freezes during the winter. In the South, frost depths can be as shallow as 5 inches. In northern states, harsher winters push the frost depth to over 5 feet.

Water service lines aren’t buried at the frost level; typically, some space is left to account for deeper freezing in a nontypical winter. In warmer climes, water service lines are buried less than 3 feet deep for this reason. In the coldest areas, they may be buried over 8 feet deep.

Pipe depth affects the cost to repair or replace. Think about it: The technician has to get to the broken line in order to work on it, so the deeper they have to dig, the more time and effort is spent in the process. That drives up the price.

What’s This Gonna Cost?
-----------------------

A small leak may be fixed by repairing or replacing just a small section of pipe. A clog or a fully compromised pipe may need to be replaced entirely. To give you an idea of what you can expect to pay for your water service line repair or replacement, HomeServe has calculated the average costs, both nationally and state by state, for comparison. Keep in mind that while these are the average prices, in some cases, costs can be much higher. In order to determine what’s wrong with your system, you’ll have to call someone out to diagnose the problem, which comes with its own cost. We’ve calculated that average, as well. As we mentioned, the depth of your pipes has a bearing on cost, so we’ve listed the average depth here, too.

There are several factors that figure into the cost to replace a water service line, so check out our state-by-state [replacement cost guide](https://www.homeserve.com/en-us/blog/cost-guide/main-water-service-line-replacement/) for specifics. Or, go to our state-by-state [repair cost guide](https://www.homeserve.com/en-us/blog/cost-guide/water-line-repair/) to learn more about what goes into repair prices.

Below, you’ll find the average costs for water service line repair and replacement in your state, plus the average depths the water lines are buried. All figures are based on aggregated HomeServe data reported by our network of thousands of contractors across the nation. Where insufficient data was available to determine a verifiable average, we’ve noted so.

(At the time of this publication, another factor dramatically driving up costs was pandemic-precipitated materials shortages, impacting home maintenance, repair and construction sectors across the board; those supply-chain issues are generally expected to be temporary and are not reflected here.)
