That being said, certain issues can result in higher repair costs. To ensure you get an accurate refrigerator repair cost estimate, here are a few things you need to know.

Average Refrigerator Repair Costs
---------------------------------

According to [HomeGuide](https://homeguide.com/costs/refrigerator-repair-cost), the average refrigerator repair cost runs around $125 to $500 (CAD 171 to CAD 683). However, it’s important to keep in mind that costs vary depending on the problem with the fridge. A small fix, such as cleaning the refrigerator coils, might only cost around $70 to $130 (CAD 96 to CAD 177), while a bigger fix, such as replacing the entire compressor, could cost between $700 and $1,250 (CAD 956 and CAD 1,707) or more.

Ultimately, people can end up paying anywhere from $70 to $1,400 (CAD 96 to CAD 1,911). Many people decide that pricier repairs aren’t worth it because, for that price, you could purchase a new refrigerator.

What’s Included in That Price?
------------------------------

When you get your bill, you’ll see an itemized list of costs. First of all, there's the cost of the diagnosis, which you pay to have an expert come to your home and figure out the problem. According to data from [HomeGuide](https://homeguide.com/costs/refrigerator-repair-cost), the diagnosis fee and first hour of labor cost about $70 to $130 (CAD 96 to CAD 177). Many companies will waive the fee if you choose to use them for repairs.

Next is the price of labor. Some companies charge an hourly rate for labor, while others charge a flat rate for each common task.

Finally, there's the price of the parts themselves. Some parts, such as connectors or hosing, may be generic parts that are fairly cheap. However, if you need a brand-name part, expect to pay a little extra.

### Common Refrigerator Repairs

The type of repair you need will have a huge impact on your refrigerator repair prices. Here’s how much you might pay to deal with some of the most common issues:

* **Refrigerant gas leak:** $400 to $1,100 (CAD 546 to CAD 1,502)
* **Dented refrigerator doors:** $125 to $250 (CAD 171 to CAD 341)
* **Motor repair:** $200 to $350 (CAD 273 to CAD 478)
* **Malfunctioning thermostat:** $100 to $400 (CAD 137 to CAD 546)
* **Malfunctioning control board:** $400 to $750 (CAD 546 to CAD 1,024)
* **Broken door seal:** $100 to $300 (CAD 137 to CAD 410)
* **Broken compressor:** $700 to $1,250 (CAD 956 to CAD 1,707)
* **Ice maker repair:** $100 to $225 (CAD 137 to CAD 307)

### Labor Costs

Most refrigerators are complex appliances that may contain dangerous refrigerant chemicals. Therefore, the cost of labor tends to be more expensive than the cost of parts. Labor costs are usually somewhere between $50 and $125 (CAD 68 and CAD 171) per hour. If you need emergency repairs on the weekend or late at night, expect to pay at least double. Most repairs aren't something a homeowner can do themselves, so it's a good idea to pay this cost instead of attempting to DIY.

### Repair Parts

Of course, the cost of parts does affect the final price. Some top refrigerator brands, such as Whirlpool and Kenmore, allow for aftermarket or generic replacement parts, but some brands, such as Liebherr, only work with proprietary parts. If you have to purchase parts straight from the manufacturer, expect to pay a premium. A brand-name control board typically costs around $100 to $300 (CAD 137 to CAD 410) or more, while a brand-name motor may cost about $150 (CAD 205).

Is It Worth It to Repair a Fridge?
----------------------------------

There are certain refrigerator fixes, such as replacing the computer controls in a high-end model, that can cost almost as much as the price of a new refrigerator. In these cases, you might be wondering whether a repair is worth it. Whether you should repair or replace depends on the age of the refrigerator. If the cost of the repair is no more than half the cost of a new refrigerator and it's not too old, you should go ahead with repairs.

A side-by-side refrigerator that's more than 7 years old or a top- or bottom-freezer model that is over 7 years old may be too old to repair. By this point, the refrigerator is reaching the end of its lifespan, so even if you fix it, it might break down again soon. Furthermore, newer models tend to be more energy-efficient, which can save you money in the long run.
