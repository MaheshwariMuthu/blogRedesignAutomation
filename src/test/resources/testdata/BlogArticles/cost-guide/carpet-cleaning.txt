  Let's be honest, here: Your carpet is underfoot and out of mind. Most of the time, professional carpet cleaning ends up being one of those tasks on the to-do list that gets postponed indefinitely.

Having your carpets professionally cleaned is not as expensive as you might think. Here’s what you need to know.

How Much Does It Cost to Have a Carpet Professionally Cleaned?
--------------------------------------------------------------

According to data from [HomeGuide](https://homeguide.com/costs/carpet-cleaning-prices), the industry average for a professional carpet cleaning is between $25 and $70 (CAD 30 and CAD 90) per room or around 25 cents (CAD 0.30) per square foot. The costs vary depending on the size of your home, the type of carpet you have and your specific requirements. You can get the most accurate price for the services you need by getting a quote from your carpet cleaning service.

You can also shave a few dollars off your bill by only professionally cleaning the carpets on the main floor of your home. Or, you may choose to skip areas with less foot traffic.

Is It Worth Getting Carpets Professionally Cleaned?
---------------------------------------------------

Over time, dust and dirt can get into the fibers of the carpet and become increasingly difficult to get out. Industrial-grade cleaning is much stronger than at-home products and can help you clean the debris that has accumulated over time. Consistent deep cleaning will keep your carpets clean and may extend their usable life.

Here are the three main reasons why professional cleaning services might be worth it:

### It Can Save You Money in the Long-Term

Regular deep cleaning can significantly prolong the lifespan of your carpets. While it may seem like an extra expense, in most cases, deep-cleaning ends up being much cheaper compared to the cost of replacing your carpets. Well-maintained carpets can last longer than 10 to 15 years. Without thorough cleaning, they may need to be replaced in 5 years.

### Professional Cleaning Can Get Rid of Stains

Professional stain removers are much more powerful than consumer-grade products. You've probably heard stories of people trying to get a stain out for hours, then contacting a professional company and having them clean everything within minutes. Heavy-duty, professional-grade cleaners can get your carpets cleaner than a vacuum.

### Take Care of Your Family's Health

As mentioned previously, your carpet collects a lot of debris, bacteria and potential allergens. These things collect in the fibers over time and get released back into the air as you walk or move on the carpets. Living with this type of debris in your home can decrease the quality of the air. It can even pose serious health hazards if your carpets are in bad condition, or if you're predisposed to respiratory problems. While at-home cleaning and vacuuming can improve this, buildup is best cleaned professionally.

How Often Should Carpets Be Cleaned?
------------------------------------

For optimal cleanliness, you might want to get carpets professionally cleaned every six to 12 months. If you have pets, young children or a particularly active lifestyle, you may find that you benefit from quarterly cleanings. Additionally, some stains and spills are too difficult to get up on your own and may require professional spot-cleaning.

How Do You Maintain the Results?
--------------------------------

We all wish cleaning was a one-and-done process, but everything needs to be maintained. Your carpets are no different.

A cleaning routine can help you maintain the condition of your carpets between professional cleaning appointments. It is advisable to vacuum at least weekly to prevent dust and dirt from accumulating. You can also use commercial spot-cleaning treatments for stains. You can find these spot treatments in home improvement stores, or you can purchase them directly from carpet cleaners.
