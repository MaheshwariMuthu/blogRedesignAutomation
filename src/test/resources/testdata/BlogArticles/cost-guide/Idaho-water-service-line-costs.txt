Potatoes aren’t the only thing going on under your soil, Idahoans. Your [water service line](https://www.homeserve.com/en-us/blog/home-improvement/exterior-water-service-lines-explained/) is under there, too. And while you can ignore this underground pipe for the most part, there are times — say, when it cracks and water starts to flood your front lawn — when you’ll need to give it your full attention. Before you panic, you should know that the average cost of replacing a water service line is actually lower in Idaho than the national average. However, keep in mind that if you just need a repair, your bill may come in a bit higher than the average American who needs the same service.

Your exterior water service line carries water from the public water main into your home. But make no mistake: Once the pipes run under your property, they’re _your_ responsibility — so you’re likely on the hook for any repair or replacement costs.

How deep your pipes are buried deeply impacts the price you pay for these services. Water service lines are buried as deep as local building codes require — but usually, the depth is determined by the frost line in your area. And the deeper the technician must dig to get to your broken or otherwise compromised line, the higher the cost.

The nationwide average water service line depth is 4.58 feet. In Idaho, these lines are buried just a few inches deeper, at 4.95 feet. For context, in _f-f-f-freezing_ Minnesota, pipe depth is more than _8_ feet.

Repair and replacement costs also vary depending on where you live. The national average for diagnosis is $222, for repair is $1,039 and for replacement is $3,581.

Below, you’ll find average service prices based on aggregated HomeServe data reported by our network of contractors across the Gem State, which should give you an approximation of how much you’ll pay to fix your out-of-commission water service line.

Water Service Line Diagnosis: $195

Before any work can begin, the technician will need to come out and run some tests to see what’s wrong with your system. In Idaho, the fee for this is 12% less than the national average.

Water Service Line Repair: $1,151

A whole host of things can cause trouble with your exterior water service line — from invading tree roots to clogs to general wear and tear. Whatever’s up with your system, the repair process will likely start with excavation to expose the pipe. Depending on your situation, the technician may need to clear a blockage, find a leak or fix the pipe — and, of course, fill the hole back in.

Idaho’s average repair price is about 11% _higher_ than the nation’s.

Water Service Line Replace: $3,484

Small sections of leaky or broken pipe can be repaired, but massive clogs or fully compromised pipes might necessitate a full replacement. Due in part to how deep your pipes are buried, water service line replacements cost Idahoans about 100 bucks less than the average American.
