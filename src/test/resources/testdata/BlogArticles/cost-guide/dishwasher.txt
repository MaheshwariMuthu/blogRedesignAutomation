How Will You Pay for a Dishwasher?
----------------------------------

The cost to purchase a dishwasher can vary significantly depending on the model and specific features. Here are the most common types of dishwashers and their features, along with price ranges for each model.

### Basic and Budget Models

#### Countertop Dishwashers

Countertop dishwashers fall in the lower price range of approximately $250 to $400 (CAD 336 to CAD 538), according to data from [HomeGuide](https://homeguide.com/costs/dishwasher-cost). These models are ideal for homes, apartments and dorms with limited space. While specific features can vary depending on the model, they typically include multiple washing options, push-button or dial controls and a capacity of up to six place settings. Countertop dishwashers are usually sized 19 inches by 21 inches, up to 17 inches by 22 inches. They connect to the home's water supply via the kitchen faucet. Countertop dishwashers are typically designed with either plastic or stainless steel inner tubs.

#### Portable Dishwashers

Portable dishwashers are also budget-friendly, with a price range of $650 to $1,000 (CAD 874 to CAD 1,344), according to HomeGuide. The units are available in countertop and under-counter models. Under-counter dishwashers are affixed with wheels for easy mobility. Specific features can vary, but most portable units offer a capacity of up to eight place settings and wash cycle programming buttons. Portable dishwashers are generally between 18 to 22 inches high and around 24 inches wide.

### Mid-Range Models

Mid-range dishwasher models are some of the most commonly purchased dishwashers because they are affordable while still offering plenty of features. Additionally, mid-range dishwashers have a larger capacity than countertop and portable budget models, making them a good choice for families and homes with multiple occupants. Similar to budget and basic units, specific features may vary depending on the model. The average cost of mid-range dishwashers is between about $800 and $1,200﻿ (CAD 1,075 and CAD 1,344).

Mid-range dishwashers are often NSF and Energy-Star Certified, making them reliable in terms of performance and energy efficiency. According to [Consumer Reports](https://www.consumerreports.org/cro/dishwashers/buying-guide/index.htm), their features include soil sensors, flexible flatware slots, sturdy racks and either buttons or dials to select wash cycles, temperatures and drying options. Stainless steel tubs are also a common feature, and many mid-range dishwashers include an extra soap slot for adding rinse aid liquid. Units in this price range are usually 24 to 32 inches high and are quieter than countertop or portable dishwashers.

### High-End Models

High-end dishwashers can cost anywhere from $1,200 to $3,000 (CAD 1,344 to CAD 4,033), depending on the specific features of the unit. Dishwashers in this range most often measure between 24 and 32 inches high and offer an abundance of high-tech convenience features. Like basic and mid-range models, features may vary depending on the manufacturer, design and cost, but they often include:

*   Smart technology that allows users to control the dishwasher settings remotely via smartphones or tablets
*   Soil sensors that adjust water usage based on the soil level of each load
*   Multiple cycle options, including rinse/hold, heated dry, heavy wash, delicate wash and light wash

How Much Does Installation Cost?
--------------------------------

When plumbers are contracted to install dishwashers, the overall costs are based on their hourly rates. Certain dishwashers can also be installed in a DIY fashion by carefully following the included instruction manuals. However, if you don't have a good understanding of your plumbing system, it's always a good idea to enlist the services of a professional to avoid issues that may hinder the overall function of your dishwasher.

While specific rates can vary, the national average cost of installing a dishwasher ranges between $45 and $150 (CAD 60 and CAD 202) per hour, according to HomeGuide. It's important to note that these costs are just for installation. You may receive a higher estimate if additional plumbing work is required to properly install your dishwasher.

How Long Do Dishwashers Last?
-----------------------------

The lifespan of a dishwasher is approximately [seven to 12 years](https://prudentreviews.com/how-long-do-dishwashers-last/), with most lasting about 9.5 years. However, your dishwasher may last longer than the average if you use it sparingly and keep it properly maintained. Overstuffing can hamper the longevity of a dishwasher because it hinders the machine's ability to thoroughly clean each dish.

Using too much dish soap or soap that's not dishwasher-safe can cause excess suds with each cycle, which can clog pipes and slow drainage. It's also important to use the hot water cycle as often as possible to prevent the buildup of soap scum and food residue.
