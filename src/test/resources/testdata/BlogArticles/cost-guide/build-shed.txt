Some say a well-built shed that looks nice will raise the value of your house. Here are some important things to consider when evaluating the cost of building a shed.

Cost to Build a Shed by Type
----------------------------

To determine shed cost, you need to figure out the type of shed you want to build. (Pricing according to [Bob Vila](https://www.bobvila.com/articles/cost-to-build-shed/).)

### Storage Shed

This type of shed is used for storing things like garden tools, lawnmowers and weed-eaters. It can also serve as a workshop and a place to keep mechanic tools and engine supplies. A simple storage shed costs as little as $300 (CAD 380), but a well-built custom shed can cost upward of $15,000 (CAD 19,200).

### Garden Shed

This is a smaller shed, often not much bigger than a wardrobe cabinet with doors, where you can place your rakes, hoes and other smaller garden equipment. A garden shed costs from $100 to $1,000 (CAD 130 to CAD 1,300) to build.

### She Shed or Man Cave

Sheds can be added to the backyard to give you extra room to escape from it all. These sheds typically have windows installed, and the inside is finished to personalize it and make it feel like home. The cost of building a shed with a hangout space runs between $5,000 and $15,000 (CAD 6,400 and CAD 19,200).

### Run-in Shed

When wind, rain or snow starts battering an area, farm and house animals need a place to go to get out of the elements. A run-in shed gives them the cover they need. These types of sheds cost about $1,500 to $10,000 (CAD 1,900 to CAD 12,800) to construct.

Cost Factors
------------

### Size

You need to consider the height, length and width (together, the cubic footage) of the shed to determine how much it will cost to build. A small 4-foot by 7-foot shed will cost around $100 to $1,000 (CAD 130 to CAD 1,300) to build, but a larger 12-foot by 16-foot one generally costs between $3,000 and $15,000 (CAD 3,800 and CAD 19,200).

### Materials

What your shed is made out of will determine the cost. A small, prefab vinyl unit starts at around $200 (CAD 260), but a metal shed will cost from $500 to $7,000 (CAD 640 to CAD 9,000). Wood sheds can be built for $3,000 to $15,000 (CAD 3,800 and CAD 19,200). Brick sheds, the most costly to build, can cost upwards of $30,000 (CAD 38,400).

### Style

The style and purpose of a shed also affect the price. A garden shed for storing tools is less expensive than a shed intended to be an extra living space because you don’t need to finish the inside. Adding elements like windows will bump up the cost.

### Permits

In many jurisdictions, you will have to get a permit to construct a shed. The cost for permits can run as high as $100 (CAD 130).

DIY Shed Costs
--------------

Building a shed yourself is an ideal way to save money — provided you know what you're doing. For most home DIYers, the easiest way to build the shed is by purchasing a kit. The kits average $1,500 to $4,000 (CAD 1,900 to CAD 5,100) and come with everything you need for the actual construction of the shed.

If you need to install a concrete pad to rest the shed on (this is required in some areas), this can raise the cost by $4,000 to $12,300 (CAD 5,100 to 15,800), depending on the size of the pad. Unless you're really good at working with concrete, this job is best left to a professional.

Another factor when doing it yourself is deciding if you are going to add electricity to the shed. It’s probably not necessary for a simple tool shed, but if you want any sort of lighting or outlets, you’re going to need to call an electrician to hook it up. Hiring a licensed electrician can add another $600 to $2,200 (CAD 770 to CAD 2,800) to the project.

If You Don’t Decide to DIY...
-----------------------------

If you are thinking of hiring labor to help you, you can expect to pay around $50 to $100 (CAD 65 to CAD 130) per hour, depending on where you live.<br><iframe title="YouTube video player" width="1072" height="603" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/reJaChMAC_w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
