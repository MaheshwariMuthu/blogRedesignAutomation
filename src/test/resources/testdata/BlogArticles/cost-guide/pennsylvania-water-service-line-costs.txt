The confluence of the three rivers right in the heart of downtown Pittsburgh is a natural gem that sets the Steel City of Western Pennsylvania apart from other Rust Belt metropolises — but when there’s a river running through the heart of your _lawn_, there’ll be _Monongahela_ to pay. In a four-seasons climate like that of the Keystone State, dramatic swings in temperature — not to mention careless digging and encroaching tree roots — can cause catastrophic leakage from your home’s underground water line. But once you’re past the initial freak-out, the Commonwealth can take comfort in knowing that, whether your town prefers a Primanti or a Philly cheesesteak, homeowners across the state pay a little less for water-line work than the average American.

Your exterior water service line carries water from the publicly maintained water distribution system into your home. But make no mistake: Once the pipes run under your property, they’re _your_ responsibility — so you’re likely on the hook for any repair or replacement costs.

How deep your pipes are buried deeply impacts the price you pay for these services. Water service lines are buried as deep as local building codes require — but usually, the depth is determined by the frost line in your area. And the deeper the technician must dig to get to your broken or otherwise compromised line, the higher the cost.

The nationwide average water service line depth is 4.58 feet. In Pennsylvania, these lines are buried 4.62 feet deep on average. That’s right on par with the national figure, which partially accounts for why PA peeps pay pretty close to what it costs Americans at large. (Consider yourselves fortunate, Pennsylvanians: Pipe depth is more than _8_ feet up in _f-f-f-freezing_ Minnesota.)

Repair and replacement costs also vary depending on where you live. The national average for diagnosis is $222, for repair is $1,039 and for replacement is $3,581.

Below, you’ll find average service prices based on aggregated HomeServe data reported by our network of contractors across Pennsylvania, which should give you an approximation of how much you’ll pay to fix your out-of-commission water service line.

Water Service Line Diagnosis: $159
----------------------------------

Before any work can begin, the technician will need to come out and run some tests to see what’s wrong with your system. In Pennsylvania, the fee for this is 28% lower than the national average.

Water Service Line Repair: $964
-------------------------------

A whole host of things can cause trouble with your exterior water service line — from invading tree roots to clogs to general wear and tear. Whatever’s up with your system, the repair process will likely start with excavation to expose the pipe. Depending on your situation, the technician may need to clear a blockage, find a leak or fix the pipe — and, of course, fill the hole back in.

Pennsylvania’s average repair price is about 7% lower than the nation’s.

Water Service Line Replace: $3,154
----------------------------------

Small sections of leaky or broken pipe can be repaired, but massive clogs or fully compromised pipes might necessitate a full replacement. Water service line replacements cost Pennsylvanians about 12% less than the average American.
