  Selecting a material for your home's exterior is an important decision. Siding impacts not only your home’s appearance, but also its value, maintenance needs and resistance from the elements. Stucco is a durable and attractive option that can last for decades when properly installed and maintained.

Curious how much it would cost to stucco your home? Here’s a cost breakdown.

Average Cost Per Square Foot
----------------------------

According to [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/home-improvement/cost-to-stucco-a-house/), the total cost per square foot can range from $6 to $9 (CAD 7.50 to CAD 11.50), depending on several factors, including:

*   The size of the home
*   Complexity of architecture
*   Type of stucco
*   Labor costs
*   Type of siding material already on the home
*   Location of the home

### Materials

Stucco materials cost between $5 and $6 (CAD 6.50 to CAD 7.50) per square foot, though higher quality materials may cost more. Most types of stucco require you to apply three coats to a home's surface, but one-coat stucco is available. One-coat stucco is more expensive but requires less labor to install. Weather-repellent treatments also cost extra but increase longevity.

### Installation

Installation is a big part of the cost to stucco a house. Labor prices range from $2 to $3 (CAD 2.50 to CAD 4) per square foot. These factors can complicate installation, leading to higher labor costs:

*   Multiple stories
*   Complex architecture
*   Removal of old siding
*   A home with a surface that's difficult to prepare for stucco application

Although you can avoid labor costs by doing the job yourself, you'll probably want to hire a professional. Poor installation can cause cracking and chipping, which ruin the stucco's durability. To install stucco yourself, you’ll have to purchase special tools and safety equipment. You’ll also need favorable weather and a properly prepared application surface.

Total Cost to Stucco a House
----------------------------

The overall cost to stucco a house depends on the factors listed above. Here are some average rates for homes of different sizes to help you estimate costs:

### How Much Does It Cost to Stucco a 1,000-Square-Foot House?

The installation cost for a small, one-story house is relatively modest. Even with complex architecture or siding preparation expenses, the total amount is usually less than $8,000 (CAD 10,200), according to [Fixr](https://www.fixr.com/costs/stucco-siding-installation).

### How Much Does It Cost to Stucco a 1,500-Square-Foot House?

A smaller two-story house usually costs up to $12,000 (CAD 15,400) to stucco, and a one-story 1,500-square-foot home may be slightly less.

### How Much Does It Cost to Stucco a Larger Home?

A larger, 2,500-square-foot home can cost between $15,000 and $20,000 (CAD 19,200 and CAD 25,700) to stucco. Pricing ultimately depends on exterior square footage and other factors. Exterior Insulation and Finish Systems provide extra protection against damage and weather and cost an extra $3 to $5 (CAD 4 to CAD 6.50) per square foot.

Cost Comparison
---------------

Stucco tends to be more expensive to install than other types of siding, but it may save you money over time because it's more durable than other options. For comparison, vinyl siding costs about [$4 to $15](https://www.fixr.com/costs/vinyl-siding#vinyl-siding-cost-per-square-foot-of-siding) (CAD 5 to CAD 19) per square foot. Total costs for a 1,500-square-foot exterior range from about $6,000 to $23,000 (CAD 7,800 to CAD 29,500). Cedar or other wood siding typically costs between [$7,000 and $23,000](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/home-improvement/wood-siding-average-cost/) (CAD 9,000 and CAD 29,500) for whole-house installation.

Vinyl and cedar siding can last 20 to 40 years, while properly installed stucco can last 50 years or more, according to [The Spruce](https://www.thespruce.com/basics-of-stucco-finish-1821950). Wood siding requires significant maintenance, and vinyl siding can be damaged by weather and sun exposure.

Should I Avoid Buying a Home With Stucco Siding?
------------------------------------------------

Stucco is a high-quality material, but it does have some downsides. In areas with clay or expansive soils, stucco siding can be problematic since it's susceptible to cracking when foundations shift or settle. Stucco may not be the best choice for homes facing exceptional precipitation or ground moisture, either.

Even in normal climates, moisture can leak through cracked stucco, damaging the stucco as well as the underlying home. Repairing this damage can be tricky, and professionals may charge between $8 and $50 (CAD 10 and CAD 65) per square foot for stucco repairs, including the cost of materials.

However, stucco can also be resilient and long-lasting, especially in dry, sunny climates. You may be able to do minor repairs yourself, and stucco can be painted with regular house paint if desired.

Does Stucco Siding Increase Home Value?
---------------------------------------

[HGTV](https://www.hgtv.com/outdoors/outdoor-remodel/maximum-value-home-exterior-projects-siding) says well-maintained stucco is an impressive, high-value improvement that can increase a home's curb appeal and value. However, stucco that's cracked or damaged won't have the same impact.
