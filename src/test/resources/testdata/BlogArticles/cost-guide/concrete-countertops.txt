Understanding how much concrete countertops cost to make and install and how they compare to other options can help you decide if they're the right choice for your home.

How Much Do Concrete Countertops Cost to Install?
-------------------------------------------------

How much a concrete countertop costs to make and install varies widely because they're custom-made. Therefore, how much you’ll pay depends on how many countertops you need, their size and what finish you want.

The materials to make a concrete countertop are relatively inexpensive, costing between $5 and $15 (CAD 6.87 to CAD 21) per square foot, according to data from [HomeGuide](https://homeguide.com/costs/concrete-countertops-cost).

Most of the cost of installing a concrete countertop comes from the labor fees to mold, fabricate and finish your countertop. Therefore, you should expect to pay between $50 and $150 (CAD 69 and CAD 206) per square foot on average, including installation labor.

The cost to install a concrete countertop ranges between [$1,500 and $6,000](https://homeguide.com/costs/concrete-countertops-cost) (CAD 2,060 and CAD 8,242) for an average kitchen.

However, you could pay as little as $1,000 (CAD 1,374) for a 20-square-foot concrete countertop without any decorative finish. Meanwhile, installing 60 square feet of concrete countertops in a kitchen with integrated fixtures, a custom finish and a kitchen island could cost as much as $9,000 (CAD 12,363).

What Are the Benefits of Concrete Countertops?
----------------------------------------------

The primary benefit of concrete countertops is that there are plenty of customization options. Concrete countertops are made to order, letting you choose your own color and decorative finishes. Etching or stamping the concrete or embedding embellishments can produce a range of effects that would be impossible to achieve with any other material.

Concrete also resists scratching reasonably well, making it a durable material for countertops. Therefore, installing concrete countertops could increase your home's resale value in the future.

Are Concrete Countertops as Durable as Other Options?
-----------------------------------------------------

According to [Family Handyman](https://www.familyhandyman.com/article/concrete-countertops-pros-and-cons/), concrete countertops can last a lifetime if you install and care for them correctly. Concrete is one of the most durable countertop materials available and provides better heat resistance than laminate. However, it's prone to stains and scratches if it isn't sealed properly — though no more prone to scratching than any other countertop material.

Concrete countertops are susceptible to cracking, especially if you have your countertops poured in place instead of installing pre-molded counters. These cracks are usually caused by applying too much pressure to the counter or by the house shifting as it settles. However, cracked concrete countertops are reasonably easy to repair, and you can reduce the risk by adding reinforcement like wire mesh. You may also need to install structural support around weak points like sinks and hobs or cooktops to protect against cracks.

How Do You Maintain Concrete Countertops?
-----------------------------------------

The first step to maintaining a concrete countertop is sealing it properly to protect it from stains and scratches. You can then clean your countertops regularly with a mild, pH-neutral detergent and a soft cloth. Avoid using harsh chemicals or scrubbing pads to clean your concrete countertop because they can scratch the surface or damage the finish.

Are Concrete Countertops Cheaper Than Granite or Other Stone?
-------------------------------------------------------------

Concrete countertops cost significantly less to make and install than stone countertops if you make them yourself. However, DIY concrete countertops are difficult to mold and require specialist knowledge and equipment, so it's usually best to hire a countertop contractor.

The cost of professionally installing a granite countertop is usually comparable to the cost of professionally installing a concrete countertop. According to [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/home-improvement/kitchen/granite-countertops-cost/), a 30-square-foot granite countertop will set you back between $2,000 and $4,500 (CAD 2,747 and CAD 6,181) on average, including installation. However, the price of granite can vary considerably, with tiles priced between $5 and $15 (CAD 6.87 and CAD 21) per square foot and slabs ranging from $40 to $100 (CAD 55 to CAD 137) per square foot.

Concrete countertops are usually more affordable than marble. [Fixr](https://www.fixr.com/costs/marble-countertops) says you should expect to pay between $1,200 and $6,000 (CAD 1,648 and CAD 8,242) for a 30- to 40-square-foot countertop. According to [Bob Vila](https://www.bobvila.com/articles/marble-countertops-cost/), the average cost is around $40 (CAD 55) per square foot for Carrara marble, which is one of the most commonly used marble types for countertops.
