But how much does it cost to build a brick pizza oven, and are they worth the money? Here’s what you need to know.

How Much Do Pizza Ovens Cost?
-----------------------------

There are many kinds of pizza ovens, which means there isn’t a simple answer to this question. A small, basic pizza oven may have a price tag as low as $200, according to [Popular Mechanics](https://www.popularmechanics.com/home/g35744736/best-outdoor-pizza-ovens/). On the other hand, a high-end, professionally installed unit can cost upwards of several thousand dollars, based on data from [Family Handyman](https://www.familyhandyman.com/article/outdoor-pizza-ovens/). The cost to build a brick pizza oven can be less than that, however. If you have the skills to build a pizza oven yourself, it could save you several hundred dollars.

If you decide to do it yourself, make sure you choose the right materials and follow an [installation guide](https://www.homeserve.com/en-us/blog/how-to/build-brick-pizza-oven/). A poorly constructed oven could be a safety risk.

--------------------------------------------------

Although prices may vary depending on the retailer, where you live and the quality of the supplies, the material cost to build a large, wood-fired brick pizza oven typically ranges [between $700 and $800](https://www.vtwoodsmoke.org/cost-to-build-a-pizza-oven-how-much-money-will-you-spend/) (CAD 940 and CAD 1,100). Special accessories may add even more to the cost. However, brick ovens are the most expensive option. Clay and concrete ovens typically cost less if you build them yourself. You can also find affordable oven kits that include the fire bricks and other materials needed for creating a dome-shaped outdoor pizza oven.

If you choose to hire a contractor to build the oven for you, the cost will vary depending on the size of the oven. A small oven, which is perfect for most families, can be erected in about two hours if you have the right tools and materials.

Are Pizza Ovens Worth It?
-------------------------

Pizza ovens are a lovely luxury, a lot like traditional wood-burning fireplaces. They look rustic and attractive, and they can save you a lot of time compared to making pizza in a traditional oven. If you put your pizza oven next to a covered patio or deck area where you can prepare food easily, you'll find it ideal for outdoor entertaining.

For many people, pizza parties are the new barbecue. A dome-shaped pizza oven — especially one made of rustic fire bricks — is more than just a cooking system. It's a stylish focal point for your garden.

There are some who feel that cheaper types of pizza ovens, especially concrete ones, produce poor-quality pizza. Wood-burning pizza ovens, on the other hand, are popular because many people feel wood-firing improves the taste of the food. It's that great taste that makes DIY pizza ovens increasingly popular. Wood-burning stoves are a little fussier to use than a traditional gas stove or fireplace, but if you love cooking or want to have that authentic Italian experience, a brick pizza oven is worth the cost.
