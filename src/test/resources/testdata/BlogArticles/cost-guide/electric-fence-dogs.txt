We get it: You love your animals, but you also love your yard. An invisible electric fence is an animal containment system designed to keep your pets within the confines of your yard. You can also establish pet-free zones to keep your animals out of specified areas.

Installing a hidden underground pet fence can allow your pet to enjoy your yard, too. Curious how much an invisible electric fence will set you back? Here’s a cost breakdown.

How Does an Invisible Electric Fence Work?
------------------------------------------

Unlike traditional physical fences that might be constructed with wood, chain link or mesh, an invisible electric fence is an underground wire that's placed around the perimeter of your yard or some other area you designate.

Most invisible fencing kits include an antenna, wireless transmitter, battery-operated collar and receiver. When your pet approaches the underground wire, the receiver sends a signal to the collar, which provides a mild shock. If the animal does not turn back, the collar sends a static correction. You can customize the signal strength to your pet; this usually depends on your animal’s size. Some systems administer a warning sound instead of a small shock before delivering a static correction.

Invisible Electric Fence Installation Costs
-------------------------------------------

According to [Home Garden Guides](https://homegardenguides.com/fencing/invisible-fence-cost/), installing an invisible electric pet fence costs between $950 and $1,500 (CAD 1,250 and CAD 1,950) for an average-sized backyard. This price includes materials and installation.

There are a few additional considerations, including the size of your yard and the number of pets you have. If you have more than one animal, you will need more collars, which cost around $105 each.

Collar batteries typically last three months to one year before they need to be replaced. If you live in an area with frequent thunderstorms, adding a lightning protector to prevent power surges may be a good idea. A lightning protector runs about [$35 to $55](https://www.thegoodypet.com/how-much-does-a-wireless-invisible-fence-cost) (CAD 45 to CAD 70).

How Much Does an Invisible Electric Fence Cost Per Foot?
--------------------------------------------------------

Depending on type and brand, an underground electric fence costs between $1.75 and $2.75 (CAD 2 to CAD 3.50) per linear foot.

Is an Invisible Electric Fence Safe for Pets and People?
--------------------------------------------------------

Invisible electric fences are safe for pets and people. In fact, the underground fences produce a low-voltage current that does not harm humans or animals. It uses the same amount of power as a 5-watt night light.

The Pros and Cons of an Electric Dog Fence
------------------------------------------

The experts at Veterinary Centers of America recommend pet owners install some form of [fencing around a property](https://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/the-pros-and-cons-of-invisible-fences-for-dogs) for their animals. Fenced-in animals are less likely to be hit by vehicles and are protected against pet thieves. They are also less likely to have potentially harmful interactions with other animals and people.

### Pros of an Invisible Electric Fence

* **Maintains yard aesthetics.** You don’t have to put up an eyesore of a fence. An invisible electric fence lets homeowners enjoy their yard without having their view blocked.
* **Affordable.** Standard fences can easily cost a few thousand dollars — once you factor in materials, labor and other fees — while wireless or in-ground fences cost a fraction of that.
* **Maintenance is easy.** Physical fences often need frequent maintenance, from sealing to repairs. Invisible electric fences often require less upkeep. And because your pet can’t dig, tear or hit an underground fence, there is less likelihood of damage.

### Cons of an Invisible Electric Fence

* **It’s not a physical barrier.** An ambitious animal — or one who doesn’t mind the shock — can still cross the invisible boundaries and dart off when you least expect it.
* **Doesn’t protect against outside intruders.** While invisible electric fences are designed to keep your pets inside your yard, there is nothing to keep intruders, including wildlife and strangers, out.
* **Power outages.** If your power is turned off or the collar battery runs down, your pet can escape and run off.

Professional Installation or DIY?
---------------------------------

Installing an invisible electric fence on your own can be a hassle, but it’s not impossible. You will want to make sure you have a detailed map of your property before you start digging. Depending on your jurisdiction, you may need to call 811 or another before-you-dig number to ensure you don’t hit any underground utilities.

While going the DIY route might be more affordable, hiring a professional installer will save you time and energy. With a professional installer or company, you will get ongoing support, pet training and a warranty on labor and equipment. Some companies also offer battery subscription plans so you’ll never be without collar batteries.
