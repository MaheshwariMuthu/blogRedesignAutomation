  The Diamond State really is a gem of the East Coast, proof that the best things come in small packages. In Delaware, you’re almost never farther than an hour’s drive from the shore. Unfortunately, you’re also never more than a small malfunction away from a pricey water heater repair — or worse, a _full replacement_. The good news? Delawareans pay less to service their water heaters than the average American.

Your water heater — excuse us, _wooder_ heater — powers your dishwasher, clothes washer and the hot shower you crave at the end of the day. When it goes kaput, it's not so much a matter of _whether_ you should have it serviced, but how much that service will cost. And if your hot water is already out, the last thing you want is to be hit with sky-high water heater service fees. Calling around for estimates? These figures should give you a ballpark idea of how much you can expect to pay, whether you live up in New Castle County or down in the Slower Lower.

Repair and replacement costs vary depending on where you live. For comparison, the national average for diagnosis is $99, for repair is $493 and for replacement is $1,741.

The following average prices are based on aggregated HomeServe data reported by our network of contractors across the state of Delaware.

Water Heater Diagnosis: $74
---------------------------

The diagnostic fee is what the technician will charge you to tell you what’s wrong with your system and whether it needs to be repaired or replaced. In the First State, this fee is about 25% lower than the national average.

Water Heater Repair: $319
-------------------------

The price you pay for water heater repairs varies based on the part that’s broken. You might get off easy if you just need to fix the gas shutoff valve, but you’ll be looking at a much higher bill if you need to replace the heating elements. This average repair price includes replacement parts and the labor to install them. Repairs cost Delawareans an average of 35% less than the U.S. overall.

Water Heater Replace: $1,552
----------------------------

Water heaters don’t last forever, and a breakdown might be a sign that yours is on its way out. At the end of your water heater’s usable life (about 10 years), you'll need to spring for a new one. Delaware’s average replacement price is more than 11% less than the nation’s.

(Note that HomeServe water heater data should generally be assumed to refer to conventional “tanked” models — the most common type — as opposed to tankless or “on-demand” models, which can cost roughly twice as much.)
