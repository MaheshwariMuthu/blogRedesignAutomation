There’s nothing prettier than a New England fall — evidenced by all the [leaf peepers](https://www.ctvisit.com/articles/7-unique-ways-to-enjoy-leaf-peeping-in-Connecticut) who make their way up to Connecticut every year just to get a gander at the colorful trees. And while you Connecticuters (Connecticutians?) probably expect a yard full of golden leaves each autumn, you may not expect a [water service line](https://www.homeserve.com/en-us/blog/home-improvement/exterior-water-service-lines-explained/) malfunction that leaves your front lawn looking like the Long Island Sound. _Where are you going to have that bonfire_ _now?_ If you just need some water service line repairs, you’re in luck; repair prices in Connecticut are, generally, a little lower than the national average. A full replacement, on the other hand, is likely going to cost you more than what the average American pays.

Your exterior water service line carries water from the public water main into your home. But make no mistake: Once the pipes run under your property, they’re _your_ responsibility — so you’re likely on the hook for any repair or replacement costs.

How deep your pipes are buried deeply impacts the price you pay for these services. Water service lines are buried as deep as local building codes require — but usually, the depth is determined by the frost line in your area. And the deeper the technician must dig to get to your broken or otherwise compromised line, the higher the cost.

The nationwide average water service line depth is 4.58 feet. Connecticut’s lines are buried 7.32 feet deep — the second deepest in the nation behind _f-f-f-freezing_ Minnesota, where pipe depth is more than _8_ feet.

Repair and replacement costs also vary depending on where you live. The national average for diagnosis is $222, for repair is $1,039 and for replacement is $3,581.

Below, you’ll find average service prices based on aggregated HomeServe data reported by our network of contractors across Connecticut, which should give you an approximation of how much you’ll pay to fix your out-of-commission water service line.

Water Service Line Diagnosis: $150
----------------------------------

Before any work can begin, the technician will need to come out and run some tests to see what’s wrong with your system. In the Constitution State, the fee for this is 32% lower than the national average.

Water Service Line Repair: $972
-------------------------------

A whole host of things can cause trouble with your exterior water service line — from invading tree roots to clogs to general wear and tear. Whatever’s up with your system, the repair process will likely start with excavation to expose the pipe. Depending on your situation, the technician may need to clear a blockage, find a leak or fix the pipe — and, of course, fill the hole back in.

Connecticut’s average repair price is about 6% lower than the nation’s.

Water Service Line Replace: $4,088
----------------------------------

Small sections of leaky or broken pipe can be repaired, but massive clogs or fully compromised pipes might necessitate a full replacement. Water service line replacements cost Connecticut denizens about 14% _more_ than the average American.
