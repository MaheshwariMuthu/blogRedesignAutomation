  Whether you use it for sitting outside and reading a book or entertaining guests for a cookout, your outdoor patio is a high-use area, especially during the summer months. In some cases, your patio may sink over time, leaving you with an uneven surface that’s both a dangerous tripping hazard and an eyesore.

Once you notice that your patio is sinking, it’s probably time to address the issue. Waiting can lead to bigger and more expensive problems. Plus, concrete leveling (also called “mudjacking”) costs less than you might think. We’ve got everything you need to know, below.

How Much Does Mudjacking Cost?
------------------------------

If you find your patio is sinking or has become uneven, concrete leveling is probably the solution. From the looks of it, you may think that all that is needed is to mix up some concrete and add it _on top_ of the spot that is uneven. However, the fix is not as simple as that. The issue may actually lie underneath the concrete slab, meaning a more complicated fix is necessary.

One way of addressing the issue is by leveling the concrete in a process called mudjacking. According to [HomeGuide](https://homeguide.com/costs/mudjacking-cost), mudjacking costs between $3 to $6 (CAD 4 and CAD 8) per square foot. It gets its name because the concrete will be "jacked" up by injecting a mud-like slurry of cement, topsoil and water underneath the concrete that has sunk.

In this process, holes are drilled into the existing concrete, and the slurry is pumped into the holes. The slurry then lifts up the concrete surface from underneath, leveling it to its original height. Mudjacking is best for concrete that is not normally holding large weight loads like patios, outdoor kitchens, driveways, sidewalks, steps and decks. It has a curing time of 24 to 48 hours and lasts for 5 to 10 years.

How Much Does Poly Leveling Cost?
---------------------------------

Another way to level concrete is with poly leveling. Poly leveling costs between $5 to $25 (CAD 7 to CAD 34) per square foot. It is similar to mudjacking, but instead of pumping a slurry under the concrete, polyurethane foam is injected.

With poly leveling, small holes are drilled into the concrete slab, and polyurethane foam is then injected into the holes. The polyurethane foam expands and levels the sunken concrete. Poly leveling is best for concrete that holds big weight loads like garage floors, basement floors and foundations, but it can be used for patios. It cures in 30 minutes to an hour and lasts for more than 10 years.

While the costs of mudjacking and poly leveling may appear to be steep, the cost of the complete replacement of a concrete slab is far greater. In order to replace the slab, your contractor would have to break up and remove the existing concrete and then pour a whole new slab. Considering the cost of replacement, mudjacking and poly leveling are more affordable options.

What Is the Cheapest Way to Level a Concrete Floor?
---------------------------------------------------

The cheapest way to level a concrete floor is with concrete leveling or mudjacking. Concrete leveling costs $3 to $6 (CAD 4 and CAD 8) per square foot.  Although concrete leveling and mudjacking are the cheaper options, your decision should not be made only on cost. Other factors, such as the area to be leveled, must be taken into consideration.

Load-bearing concrete areas like foundations, basement floors and garage floors are better addressed with poly leveling, while patios, outdoor kitchens and driveways are better suited to mudjacking. Before making any decision, it's best to call in a professional to be sure the underlying issue is addressed properly. You don't want to wait too long and have to completely replace the concrete — a far more costly procedure.
