  Life may be as peaceful as a baby’s sigh in your Tennessee mountain home, as the song asserts — but few things can throw cold water on a serene scene like suddenly losing hot water in the shower. Yeah, a malfunctioning water heater is a huge bummer, but no reason to cry a river, Big Bend State residents. The good news for Tennesseans budgeting for eventual water heater maintenance is that, compared with the average cost among your fellow Americans, you all pay a little less for both repairs and replacement.

Your water heater powers your dishwasher, clothes washer and the hot shower you crave at the end of the day. When it goes kaput, it's not so much a matter of _whether_ you should have it serviced, but how much that service will cost. And if your hot water is already out, the last thing you want right now is to be blindsided by exorbitant water heater service fees. If you’re calling around for estimates, these figures should give you a ballpark idea of how much you can expect to pay, from Graceland to the Great Smoky Mountains.

Repair and replacement costs vary depending on where you live. For comparison, the national average for diagnosis is $99, for repair is $493 and for replacement is $1,741.

The following average prices are based on aggregated HomeServe data reported by our network of contractors across the state of Tennessee:

Water Heater Diagnosis: $82
---------------------------

The technician will charge you a fee to come out to your home, tell you what’s wrong with your system and determine whether it needs to be repaired or replaced. For Tennessee denizens at large‚ this fee is 17% less than the national average.

Water Heater Repair: $398
-------------------------

Any number of things may be going wrong with your water heater — issues with the gas control valve, a faulty thermostat or a combination of several malfunctions. This estimated repair price includes replacement parts and the labor to install them. Water heater repairs cost the average Tennessee resident roughly 19% less than they do nationwide.

Water Heater Replace: $1,603
----------------------------

Water heaters don’t last forever, and a breakdown might be a sign that yours is on its way out. At the end of your water heater’s usable life (about 10 years), you'll need to spring for a new one. Tennessee’s average replacement price is 8% less than that of the nation.

(Note that HomeServe water heater data should generally be assumed to refer to conventional “tanked” models — the most common type — as opposed to tankless or “on-demand” models, which can cost roughly twice as much.)
