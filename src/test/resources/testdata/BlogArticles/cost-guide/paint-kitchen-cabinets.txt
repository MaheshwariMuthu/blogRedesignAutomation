How Much Does Painting Kitchen Cabinets Cost If You DIY?
--------------------------------------------------------

If you’re working with a tight budget, it’s smart to paint kitchen cabinets yourself. Kitchen cabinet painting is a relatively simple skill, but the job involves plenty of labor and tedious work. And it’s not just painting — removing and cleaning kitchen cabinets can be quite the chore as well.

When you choose to do it yourself, you take on those labor challenges, eliminating the majority of the costs associated with hiring a pro. On average, you can expect the cost of paint and materials to run between $200 and $500 (CAD 255 to CAD 640), according to [The Spruce](https://www.thespruce.com/how-to-paint-kitchen-cabinets-4163348). If this is your first home reno project, you might need to purchase items like a paint sprayer.

Here’s what you’ll need to complete your cabinet painting project:

*   Paint and primer
*   Brushes and rollers
*   Paint trays
*   Painters tape
*   Drill or screwdriver (for removing cabinets)
*   Cleaning materials
*   Sandpaper
*   Plastic tarps for the ground

### Pros and Cons of DIY Cabinet Painting

**Pros:**

*   Saves a significant amount of money
*   No need for other people to enter your home
*   It’s a simple project with a big impact on the look of the space

**Cons:**

*   Project can consume a lot of time and energy
*   DIY painted cabinets will likely start chipping faster than professionally painted ones
*   Any mistakes are yours to deal with
*   Without a paint sprayer (which can be difficult to use), you might end up with visible paint streaks.

How Much Does It Cost to Have Kitchen Cabinets Professionally Painted?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Despite kitchen cabinet painting being a pretty straightforward concept, the project still involves a lot of hard work that you might not be prepared to take on. If you’re unable to do the job yourself, [Bob Vila](https://www.bobvila.com/articles/cost-to-paint-kitchen-cabinets/) says you expect to pay around $30 to $60 (CAD 40 to CAD 75) per linear foot for a professional to do it for you. This cost estimate covers materials, labor and supplies. If you have kitchen cabinets that are difficult to remove (like if they’re inset with glass, or configured in a tight or awkward layout), you can expect to pay a little extra.

### Pros and Cons of a Professional Kitchen Cabinet Paint Job

**Pros:**

*   You’ll get quality results that should last for years
*   Professionals are less likely to make mistakes
*   Project may be completed quickly and efficiently
*   No stress or hard work for you

**Cons:**

*   May cost significantly more than DIY
*   You’ll have to deal with contractors being in your space

What Factors Make Up the Price?
-------------------------------

There are plenty of factors that can cause your kitchen cabinet painting costs to fluctuate. The main ones are cabinet size, cabinet material, number of cabinets, paint type, coats of paint needed and labor.

However, painting is still preferable to replacing cabinets that are in good shape. Did you know installing new kitchen cabinets can cost as much as $38,000 (CAD 48,400), depending on the materials? So, at the end of the day — whether you choose to DIY or hire a professional — painting your cabinets is the easiest way to refresh your kitchen without breaking the bank.
