Before you dive into this project, you might want to learn how much granite countertops cost and what affects the prices to determine if this option fits into your kitchen renovation budget.

How Much Does Granite Cost Per Square Foot?
-------------------------------------------

Granite countertops typically range from [$45 to $80](https://www.usamarbleandgranite.com/cost-granite-countertops/) (CAD 56 to CAD 100) per square foot, but some high-end and rare granite slabs can range from $100 to $200 (CAD 125 to CAD 250) per square foot.

Color is a major factor in pricing. Because granite is a natural stone, the color and patterning vary significantly from one slab to the next. Common colors, including white, gray and green, are often on the cheaper end, from $40 to $60 (CAD 50 to CAD 75) per square foot. Other colors that aren't as readily available, like blue and red, tend to have prices corresponding to how rare they are. Each slab is unique and is priced accordingly based on the appeal and rarity of the colors and patterning.

How Much Does It Cost to Install Granite Countertops?
-----------------------------------------------------

The labor for granite countertop installation typically ranges from $35 to $85 (CAD 45 to CAD 105) per hour. The average amount of time it takes to install granite countertops is four hours, but it could be fewer for a small, simple kitchen or much longer for a large kitchen with a complex layout. The total cost for the project depends on the price per square foot of the granite you choose, the size of your countertop space and the complexity of the project, which can also make the installation take longer.

What’s the Price Difference Between Different Grades of Granite?
----------------------------------------------------------------

Granite countertops are graded based on several factors, including color, rarity, patterning and quality. The common grades are levels one, two and three, but some granite goes up to level five. Level one is the lowest and cheapest, with the price increasing with each level. You might also see the grades described with letters, starting with A at the bottom and moving through to B, C, D and beyond.

Examples of pricing based on granite grades include:

* **Level 1:** $40 to $50 (CAD 50 to CAD 63) per square foot
* **Level 2:** $50 to $60 (CAD 63 to CAD 75) per square foot
* **Level 3:** $55 to $65 (CAD 70 to CAD 80) per square foot
* **Level 4:** $65 to $75 (CAD 80 to CAD 95) per square foot
* **Level 5:** $75 to $100 (CAD 95 to CAD 125) or more per square foot

The grading and pricing can vary, and the granite company you choose might have only certain grades of granite available. Visit several granite countertop companies to explore your options and compare pricing.

How Does the Price Compare to Quartz or Marble Counters?
--------------------------------------------------------

Comparing the cost of granite countertops to other materials can help you decide between a few options. Granite countertops are more expensive than laminate countertops, but the price is comparable with that of materials like quartz and marble.

Quartz countertops are similar to granite, with a typical cost range between $55 and $155 (CAD 70 and CAD 195) per square foot. Marble is typically higher, with the price ranging from $75 to $250 (CAD 95 to CAD 315) per square foot.

The specific material you choose will ultimately determine which option is most expensive. For example, if you choose a rare, high-end granite slab, you could end up paying more than you would for a low-end marble countertop.

Pros and Cons of Granite Countertops
------------------------------------

Price is often a deciding factor when choosing countertop materials, but other factors can also sway your decision. Looking at the pros and cons may help you decide if you want to install granite countertops in your kitchen.

### Pros

* **Unique look:** Because granite is a natural material, every slab is different. You get a beautiful centerpiece to your kitchen that's earthy and individual.
* **Durability:** You'll pay more upfront for granite countertops than some materials, but they last up to 100 years. That means it could be the last countertop you have to install.
* **Increased home value:** Granite is a timeless material and is appealing to homebuyers. When you install it, you will likely increase your home's value.
* **Easy cleaning:** When properly sealed, granite countertops are relatively easy to clean. You can use granite countertop cleaner or simply use dish soap and water to clean granite.

### Cons

* **Ongoing maintenance:** Granite countertops require regular sealing to keep them protected. If they aren't sealed well, the porous countertops can become stained easily.
* **Weight:** Granite is heavy, so your cabinetry might need to be reinforced in order to support their weight. Large countertop overhangs will also need to be reinforced.
* **Seams:** Because granite comes in slabs, you'll likely have some seams on your countertops. Solid surface countertops can be made without seams. Choose an installer that conceals the seams well.
* **Not a DIY project:** Granite requires professional installation, so it's not the best option if you want DIY countertops.
* **Price:** For some people, the high price point puts granite out of the budget.
