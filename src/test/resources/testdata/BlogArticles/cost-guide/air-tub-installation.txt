  The luxury of adding a jetted tub to your bathroom setup is unmatched. There's nothing like coming home from a long day at work and enjoying a relaxing massage in the comfort of your own home. Air tubs are a bit different than whirlpool baths, but they may actually be better suited to your needs, depending on your bathing preferences.

While an air jet tub will run you more than a traditional bathtub, many homeowners find that the perks outweigh the expense. Here’s what you can expect to spend on an air tub.

What Is an Air Tub?
-------------------

With so many jetted tubs on the market, it can be confusing to begin your search for the right model for your bathroom. So, how does an air jet tub differ from a whirlpool bathtub? The primary difference between the two types of tubs is the mechanism that operates the jets in each model. While a whirlpool tub uses water jets for its body massage features, an air jet tub shoots air instead.

The two types of jets provide a different sensation. Water jets offer high-pressure, deep massage functions, while air jets provide a more generalized full-body massage. An air jet tub is also quieter, which may make it more soothing. But for most people, the main concern when deciding which tub to choose for their bathroom will be the price.

How Much Does an Air Tub Cost?
------------------------------

When considering whether an air jet tub is a worthwhile addition to your home, you'll want to look at the cost in two separate capacities: the price of the tub itself and the installation cost.

To purchase an air jet tub on its own, you're looking at an average price of anywhere from $800 to $3,000 (CAD 1,050 to CAD 3,950), according to [HomeGuide](https://homeguide.com/costs/bathtub-installation-replacement-cost#jetted), though you may be able to find cheaper models. The price depends on a number of factors, including the shape, size and material of the tub.

The price of your tub will depend significantly on what it’s made out of. Acrylic and fiberglass tubs are the most common, and they have the lowest price points. However, top-end models may cost several thousand dollars. If you decide to go with something more unconventional, like cast iron, you may have to further expand your budget to around $13,200 (CAD 17,400). And if you really want to create a statement piece and go all out with bathroom aesthetics, you may consider investing in a unique copper air jet tub, typically costing between $1,000 and $8,000 (CAD 1,300 and CAD 10,500).

No matter your budget, there's an air jet tub out there that will suit your needs. It's critical to remember that unless you can perform the installation yourself, you’ll also need to factor in labor costs.

Installation Costs
------------------

If you're feeling ambitious and are good at home improvement, you can attempt the installation yourself to save money. Still, you'll need to invest in the proper tools and materials for the job, like:

*   Screwdriver
*   Reciprocating saw
*   Pry bar and crowbar
*   Waste and overflow unit
*   Level
*   Strainer wrench
*   Pliers
*   Hammer
*   Measuring tape
*   Lumber for framing
*   Ledger boards
*   Cement backer board
*   Utility knife
*   Safety glasses
*   Mortar mix
*   Adhesive
*   Grout
*   Silicone caulk
*   Plumber's putty
*   Putty knife

### Professional Installation

If you've opted for an affordable, lightweight acrylic air tub, you might find DIY installation quite straightforward and cost-effective. But for those who are seeking the help of a professional with their bathtub installation, labor costs between [$1,200 and $3,500](http://howmuch.net/) (CAD 1,600 and CAD 4,600). This is where the size of your chosen jetted tub comes into play financially. If you aren't performing the installation yourself, consider carefully how large of a tub you need and if it's possible to purchase a jetted tub that works with the existing framing in your bathroom. This can help bring your installation costs down.<br><iframe title="YouTube video player" width="1072" height="603" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pM2NlhbKBH0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen title="How to Drain A Water Heater | Hot Water Tank Tips"></iframe>
