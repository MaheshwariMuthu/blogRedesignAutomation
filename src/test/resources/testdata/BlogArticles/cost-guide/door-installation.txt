Door Installation Costs
-----------------------

The [average cost](https://howmuch.net/costs/door-all-install-replace) to install a door is about $675 (CAD 860). This price depends on the material and purpose of the door.

Door Costs by Type
------------------

Aside from installation, the highest cost is the price of the door itself. The material you choose for the door depends on its function. Exterior doors need to be sturdier, while interior doors can be lighter. Of course, it’s also about aesthetics; some materials create a striking look, but they carry a heftier price tag.

### Solid Wood

A wooden front door can create a pleasing, warm entrance. Prices start at $200 (CAD 250) for a [solid wood door](https://www.wcmanet.org/how-much-does-a-door-cost/), but can rise much higher depending on the quality of wood. For an exterior door, you need a wood that can withstand the weather, such as red oak or ash. If you plan on painting the wood, buy “paint-grade” rather than “stain-grade” wood to save money.

### Hollow-Core Wood

You can opt for hollow-core wood for an interior door. While the outside of the door is wood, the inner part of the door is cardboard or plastic. These retail for much cheaper, beginning as low as $20 (CAD 25). They are lighter, making them easier to install. However, they are more prone to damage.

### Steel

A steel door is a good option for a secure exterior door. These doors are thick and hard to break. However, steel is prone to scratches and dents and won't retain a pristine appearance. A good-quality [steel door](https://www.remodelingcalculator.org/steel-garage-doors/) costs at least $500 (CAD 640), but economic options start at $350 (CAD 445).

### Fiberglass

[Fiberglass doors](https://www.remodelingexpense.com/costs/cost-of-fiberglass-entry-doors/) are a great option for an exterior door in harsh weather conditions. They are low-maintenance and can give the appearance of wood without contracting or expanding as the weather changes. Prices start at about $300 (CAD 380), but it's better to invest at least $500 (CAD 640), as cheaper models can crack easily.

### Glass

Glass doors can add an elegant touch to your home. Costs for a [sliding glass door](https://homeguide.com/costs/sliding-glass-doors-prices#prices) start at about $300 (CAD 380). French doors cost about 20% more, and higher-quality models retail for much more.

### Composite Wood

A relatively new invention, composite doors are made of various materials. They can be made to look like wood but require less maintenance. [Composite front door](https://popularask.net/how-much-should-a-new-composite-front-door-cost/) prices start at $500 (CAD 640).

Installation Costs by Type
--------------------------

### Interior

An interior door installation is easier, as it involves a more lightweight door. With some research and the right tools, this can be a DIY project. If not, the labor costs will be $120 to $350 (CAD 150 to CAD 445) on average.

### Exterior

An exterior door installation or replacement will cost more as the door will be heavier. An improperly installed front door leaves your home unsecured, so follow guides closely if you decide to do it yourself. Labor costs for an exterior door installation range from $230 to $800 (CAD 290 to CAD 1,020) on average.

### Sliding

Sliding doors can cost more to install. Prices can start from about $300 (CAD 380) but can run much higher. You can reduce the installation costs by installing sliding doors yourself.

Average Total Cost
------------------

The total cost for a [door installation](https://homeguide.com/costs/door-installation-cost#labor) is about $750 (CAD 950) on average, including materials and labor. Door installation labor costs between $30 and $80 (CAD 38 and CAD 100) an hour, and total costs depend on the complexity of the project and whether there's an existing frame. You can lower the price by installing the door yourself.

Door Repairs
------------

Before choosing to replace a door, be sure that it can't be repaired. Some cracks and dents in a door cannot be repaired. Other repairs can be simple, such as fixing a broken handle or sticking sliding door. 

Other Factors That Impact Installation Price
--------------------------------------------

### Other Materials

If you pick a wooden door, you may be applying paint, varnish or stain to the wood. If you're installing the door yourself, there may be other tools and materials to buy, such as hinges, door jambs and handles. If there has been any damage to the door you're replacing, there may be some repairs to carry out. The most common is a repair to the door frame.

### Where You Buy

The average door cost differs depending on your location. For example, the average cost is lower in Denver than in New York City, and that comes down to the cost of living in these areas. You may also purchase a door online. You can find more styles at different price points online, but be sure you are buying from a reputable vendor.

### Custom-Made Doors

This article covers the basic starting prices and average costs for many doors and installation types. However, there is a range of other choices. One of the highest-priced options is commissioning a custom-made door. Depending on the commission, this may add hundreds — or even thousands — of dollars to the price.
