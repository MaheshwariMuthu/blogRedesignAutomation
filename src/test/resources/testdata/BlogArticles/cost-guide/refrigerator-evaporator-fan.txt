  Your refrigerator's evaporator fan keeps your food at a safe storage temperature by pushing air over the cold evaporator coils into the storage compartment. If your evaporator fan stops working properly, you could find yourself with a warm fridge on your hands — and even a nasty bout of food poisoning from the spoiled leftovers.

Therefore, it's essential to get your refrigerator evaporator fan repaired or replaced as soon as possible if you notice that your fridge isn't cooling correctly, or you hear annoying squeaking noises. But how much does it cost to repair an evaporator fan? And is it better to just get a new fridge?

How Much Does It Cost to Repair or Replace a Refrigerator Evaporator Fan?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

According to [House Digest](https://www.housedigest.com/1239057/refrigerator-repair-cost-high/), it generally costs between $50 and $200 (CAD 67 and CAD 268) per hour for a professional appliance technician to repair a refrigerator fan. How much it actually costs depends on the extent of the damage and your fridge's make and model.

Meanwhile, replacing the fan altogether costs between $250 and $400 (CAD 336 and CAD 537), according to [HomeGuide](https://homeguide.com/costs/refrigerator-repair-cost). Therefore, it may be more cost-effective to install a new fan than to try to fix the existing one. It could also save you the expense and hassle of repairing a worn-out unit multiple times. A repair technician can advise whether it's best to repair or replace your fan.

Is It Worth It to Replace a Refrigerator Evaporator Fan?
--------------------------------------------------------

You can generally purchase a high-quality refrigerator with basic features for somewhere between [$600 and $2,300](https://homeguide.com/costs/refrigerator-cost) (CAD 805 and CAD 3,087). However, you could end up shelling out up to $5,000 (CAD 6,710) for a fridge with integrated smart technology and other advanced features. Therefore, basic math shows that it's cheaper upfront to repair or replace a refrigerator evaporator fan than to buy a whole new fridge.

That said, a side-by-side cost comparison doesn't always reveal the whole picture. If you've had your fridge for eight years or fewer, paying to replace or repair the evaporator fan is probably a no-brainer. On the other hand, it's worth considering your fridge's age and condition if you've had it a while. With proper maintenance, you can expect a refrigerator to last [up to 20 years](https://www.forbes.com/home-improvement/kitchen/how-long-do-refrigerators-last/), but some budget brands may have shorter lifespans. It may be better to replace a fridge that's [over 10 years old](https://www.bobvila.com/slideshow/9-signs-you-need-to-replace-your-fridge-51105) because you're unlikely to get much use out of repaired or replaced parts before you need to buy a new one. Older fridges can also cost significantly more to repair than more recent models.

The decision becomes more complicated if you've had your fridge for between 8 and 10 years. If your fridge is otherwise working well and it's an energy-efficient model, it's probably worth repairing or replacing the fan. However, you might wish to consider replacing the fridge if it keeps breaking down to avoid spending money on repairing a unit that's reaching the end of its lifespan. You may also be better off replacing your fridge if it isn't energy-efficient because the potential energy savings could offset the higher upfront costs over time.<br><iframe title="YouTube video player" width="1072" height="603" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XYwWXTInE08?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen title="How To Clean Your Fridge Coils"></iframe>
