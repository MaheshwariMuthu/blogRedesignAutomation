It's best to treat mold as soon as you notice it, but many people put off dealing with the problem because they're worried about the costs. Below, you can find out how much mold removal costs and what to expect from the process.

How Does the Mold Removal Process Work?
---------------------------------------

Mold removal companies spray the affected area with biocide chemicals to kill the mold. Before starting work, the company will remove any furniture and place plastic sheeting over the floors.

The biocide must dry completely before the contractors can begin the next step. Once dry, the contractors spray the area with specially formulated paint or whitewash to cover the mold. This process is known as encapsulation because the paint encapsulates the spores to stop them from spreading.

Generally, it's best to treat as wide an area as possible, even if the mold growth is relatively limited. Therefore, it's not uncommon for mold removal companies to spray the entire room.

Mold removal services treat existing mold growth, but they don't address the root cause of the issue. Therefore, it's often best to hire a mold remediation company. Mold remediation differs from mold removal because a remediation company can investigate the cause of the mold and advise you on how to prevent a recurrence.

How Much Does Mold Removal Cost?
--------------------------------

According to [Fixr](https://www.fixr.com/costs/mold-remediation#professional-mold-removal-cost), the average homeowner spends around $3,500 (CAD 4,500) on professional mold removal, with a range between $1,500 and $4,000 (CAD 1,900 and CAD $5,100). These prices include the cost of mold remediation services to treat the root cause.

Most mold removal and remediation companies charge by surface area. Expect to pay between $10 and $25 (CAD 13 and CAD 30) per square foot.

What Factors Affect the Cost of Mold Remediation and Removal?
-------------------------------------------------------------

Understanding what factors affect the cost of mold removal can help you estimate how much you'll spend. These include:

### Infestation Size

The size of the infestation is the main factor impacting the cost of mold removal. Treating a 50-square-foot area could cost as little as $500 to $1,250 (CAD 650 to CAD 1,600). Meanwhile, remediation services for a 300-square foot room cost between $3,000 and $7,500 (CAD 3,800 and CAD 9,600).

### Location in the Home

The location of the infestation can also impact the overall cost, and hard-to-reach areas are usually the most expensive to treat. If you need to treat your entire house, expect to pay between $10,000 and $30,000 (CAD 12,800 and CAD 38,500). Here's how much it costs on average to treat the most [commonly infested areas](https://www.fixr.com/costs/mold-remediation#mold-remediation-cost-by-location):

*   Vents: $100 to $500 (CAD 130 to CAD 650)
*   Crawl space: $500 to $2,000 (CAD 650 to CAD 2,600)
*   Attic: $500 to $7,000 (CAD 650 to CAD 9,000)

### Repairs

You may need to repair your home to address the cause of your mold issue, adding between $75 and $3,000 (CAD 100 and CAD 3,800) on average to the overall bill. If you have a leak, expect to pay between $150 and $350 (CAD 190 and CAD 450) to fix a leaking pipe and between $400 and $1,000 (CAD 515 and CAD 1,300) to repair a leaking roof. The costs can be significantly higher if the damage is extensive.

If you have a moldy basement, you may need to seal the foundation and waterproof the basement to prevent water from seeping in and causing mold. On average, it costs between $2,000 and $10,000 (CAD 2,600 and CAD 12,800) to seal and waterproof a basement.

Does It Cost More to Remove Black Mold?
---------------------------------------

Black mold is more difficult to remove than most other mold types. It can also be challenging to repair the damage caused by black mold because it can stain surfaces. Therefore, black mold removal is usually more expensive, costing between $2,000 and $6,000 (CAD 2,600 and CAD 7,700) on average.

How Much Does Mildew Removal Cost?
----------------------------------

The term "mildew" encompasses several types of mold that flourish in damp areas, such as bathrooms and windowsills. [FEMA](https://www.fema.gov/pdf/rebuild/recover/fema_mold_brochure_english.pdf) describes mildew as early-stage mold, and it's usually easier to treat and remediate than a full-blown mold infestation. Therefore, expect to pay toward the lower end of the price scale for treating a mildew infestation.
