The ability to see and speak to the person at the door — whether you're home or away — can put your mind at ease. If you’re thinking of investing in a video doorbell, a Ring may be at the top of your list. But once you get your new gadget home, how much will installation cost? Here’s what you need to know.

**Do I Need an Electrician to Install a Ring Doorbell?**
--------------------------------------------------------

Many video doorbells, including those produced by Ring, are designed for easy self-installation using the wiring on your existing doorbell. If you already have a doorbell, you can install your new gadget yourself, even if you’re not especially tech-savvy. Your Ring doorbell will include the instructions and all the tools you need to mount the outdoor unit and connect it to your home’s Wi-Fi network.

Even if your Ring video doorbell is not a battery-powered model and requires hardwiring, installation should still be a relatively easy DIY project.

However, if you don’t already have a doorbell system to which you can hardwire your Ring, you will probably need to call a professional. An electrician will run new wiring to ensure the setup is ready for your Ring doorbell.

**Ring Doorbell Installation Costs**
------------------------------------

If you’re not confident you can install the Ring on your own, paying a professional could be the best option. Calling in an electrician also means a professional is on hand if any wiring issues arise. A pro can connect your new doorbell to the existing wiring, sort out any new wiring and perform tests to ensure your Ring doorbell is up and running properly.

You'll pay an electrician anywhere between $230 and $355 (CAD 310 and CAD 475) to install your Ring, according to [Porch](https://porch.com/project-cost/cost-to-install-a-doorbell). Most of this expense is for labor; most electricians charge by the hour and have a minimum required payment. Ring doorbell installation costs vary considerably, so it’s best to shop around to get the best deal.
