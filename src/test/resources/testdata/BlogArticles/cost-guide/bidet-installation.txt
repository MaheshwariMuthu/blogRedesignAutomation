  Bidets have been around for a long time all over the world, but they’re a relatively new addition to U.S. homes. They're a bathroom luxury that can help you feel clean while lowering your toilet paper consumption — saving you time and money. But how much is a bidet, and are they worth the investment?

If you're considering having a bidet installed, you may be surprised to learn that they are easy to install and more affordable than you might think. Here’s everything you need to know about installation costs.

How Much Is a Bidet?
--------------------

The average cost to install a bidet depends on whether you want a handheld bidet, a standalone ceramic model or a bidet toilet seat. If you want to keep the bidet installation cost as low as possible, a handheld bidet is the most affordable choice. According to [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/home-improvement/bathroom/bidet-cost/), prices are as low as $40 (CAD 55). Expect to pay between $100 and $300 (CAD 135 and CAD 405) to purchase and install a handheld bidet.

Bidet toilet seats with a spray nozzle offer a better cleaning experience while being a space-saving option, compared to standalone bidets. A bidet toilet seat [costs](https://www.forbes.com/home-improvement/bathroom/bidet-cost/) between $470 and $1,700 (CAD 640 and CAD 2,300) to install. Installation usually involves calling in an electrician to fit a socket. Some more expensive bidet toilet seats also have extra luxuries, such as a heated toilet seat. These can run anywhere from about $100 (CAD 135) for a basic seat to around $1,000 (CAD 1,350) for the most expensive models with the most features.

Keep in mind that the above prices assume that you're getting a bidet toilet seat installed on an existing toilet. If you're planning to get a new toilet installed, you'll have to take into account the cost of that, too.

How Much Does It Cost to Buy and Install a Bidet?
-------------------------------------------------

The average cost to install a bidet as a standalone device is usually higher. Standalone ceramic bidets are made from more expensive materials and require additional plumbing work. Installation costs for a standalone bidet start at $500 (CAD 680) but can be as high as $1,500 (CAD 2,000) if you need extensive plumbing work done. You may want to consider scheduling that installation at a time when you already have someone out to install a toilet or do other plumbing work to keep total costs to a minimum.

If you don't have the room for a standalone bidet in your bathroom, consider a handheld spray nozzle instead. These give you more control over where the water is directed, and many people find them more comfortable to use, too. Handheld bidet attachments are popular in Asia and are starting to gain traction in other parts of the world, too, because they don't require a lot of space to use and still offer great cleaning.

Is a Bidet Cheaper Than Toilet Paper?
-------------------------------------

The upfront costs of a bidet can be intimidating — especially if you want a fancy, remote-control bidet with stainless steel fixtures and the option to change the water temperature. If you're happy with a simpler portable bidet or one that can attach to an existing toilet and spray water, you’re sure to find something that’s affordable.

Over time, however, using a bidet toilet seat should cut your toilet paper usage by as much as 75%. Some people find they don't need toilet paper at all or just need enough to pat dry. It's important to take those long-term savings into account. But not everyone’s in it for the reduction in toilet paper usage; some people simply like the luxurious addition to their bathroom.
