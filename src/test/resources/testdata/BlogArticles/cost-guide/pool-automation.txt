  Once upon a time, homeowners used a series of switches and manual tools to clean and control all their pool systems. If this sounds familiar, there could be a better way.

Enter the pool automation system. These clever devices can simplify your pool care routine, but understanding the costs involved is essential.

What Is a Pool Automation System?
---------------------------------

Pool automation systems allow you to control all your pool's functions from a single control panel. For example, most systems let you:

*   Control the pool pump
*   Activate and deactivate the lights
*   Choose between spa settings
*   Set your preferred temperatures
*   Activate cleaning systems

These systems work similarly to a computer. They send information to your pool's components, so you won't need to control each part manually. The main advantage of a pool automation system is that it makes managing and maintaining your pool easier, and you won't need to worry about forgetting to clean or shut down your pool while on vacation.

They can also help you save money on your operating costs by only using high-energy settings when you need them. Some pool controllers include energy-saving settings to reduce your electricity bills. Using an automated system minimizes the risk of errors, ensuring your pool maintains the correct balance of chemicals to keep it in good condition. The most up-to-date models can even control components such as robotic pool cleaners.

Pool Automation Systems: Costs by Type
--------------------------------------

Some pool automation systems have wired connections that link to the components inside your pool. Meanwhile, smart systems wirelessly control your pump, lights and other parts via Wi-Fi. These systems are only suitable if your pool's components are smart system-capable.

Most systems include a remote control, allowing you to monitor your pool and activate your settings from the comfort of your house. The most high-tech solutions come with mobile apps, enabling you to adjust your pool settings from anywhere.

According to data from [River Pools and Spas](https://www.riverpoolsandspas.com/blog/automation-systems-for-pools), pool automation systems cost between $1,500 and $3,500 (CAD 2,048 and CAD 4,779) for the unit alone. The most affordable systems typically offer fewer features and may not include energy-saving modes and smart connectivity. At the top end of the scale, the most expensive systems usually have eco-friendly features and smartphone apps and are capable of controlling complex spa systems.

Bear in mind that the cheapest models can only control a few components at once. Premium units can handle multiple functions, with some models controlling up to 32 items.

How Much Does Pool Automation Installation Cost?
------------------------------------------------

You can often install a wireless pool automation yourself because these units don't require wiring. However, you should always leave wired installations to the professionals. Installing a wired pool automation system incorrectly near water could cause a fire hazard and increase the risk of an electric shock. Many jurisdictions require homeowners to hire an electrician with experience installing pool automation systems for safety reasons.

The cost to have a pool automation system professionally installed depends on the system's complexity and standard electrician rates in your area. Installing a modern system with basic functions takes a couple of hours, and you should expect to pay a licensed electrician between $50 and $130 (CAD 68 and CAD 178) per hour, according to [HomeGuide](https://homeguide.com/costs/electrician-cost-per-hour).

The costs really start to rack up if you want a complex system to control multiple pool functions. According to [Pool Research](https://poolresearch.com/automation/), you should expect to pay around $20,000 (CAD 27,311) for a fully automated pool system, including the cost of materials and installation labor.<br><iframe title="YouTube video player" width="1072" height="603" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-w93u9ICMks?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen title="Who the Heck Is HomeServe???"></iframe>
