Let’s face it, Nevadans. Your state needs one more demand on its already [critical water supply](https://lasvegassun.com/news/2021/aug/16/western-states-face-first-federal-water-cuts/) like it needs a hole in the Hoover Dam. So the last thing a Nevada homeowner needs is to have a veritable Lake Mead pooling up in the lawn due to a compromised [water service line](https://www.homeserve.com/en-us/blog/home-improvement/exterior-water-service-lines-explained/). Although the Silver State is commonly associated with its bone-dry, pottery-kiln-like desert heat, the average monthly low temperature [flirts with freezing](https://www.vegas.com/weather/) for roughly a third of the year — and all it takes is one out-of-character cold snap to potentially snap a home’s underground water pipes. And, unfortunately, Nevadans don’t enjoy much of a savings on repair or replacement of said pipes — _if_ any savings at all.

Your exterior water service line carries water from the public water main into your home. But make no mistake: Once the pipes run under your property, they’re _your_ responsibility — so you’re likely on the hook for any repair or replacement costs.

How deep your pipes are buried deeply impacts the price you pay for these services. Water service lines are buried as deep as local building codes require — but usually, the depth is determined by the frost line in your area. And the deeper the technician must dig to get to your broken or otherwise compromised line, the higher the cost.

The nationwide average water service line depth is 4.58 feet, but in Nevada, water lines are more than a foot shallower than that, on average, at 3.5 feet. For further context, in _f-f-f-freezing_ Minnesota, pipe depth is more than _8_ feet.

Repair and replacement costs also vary depending on where you live. The national average for diagnosis is $222, for repair is $1,039 and for replacement is $3,581.

Below, you’ll find average service prices based on aggregated HomeServe data reported by our network of contractors across Nevada, which should give you an approximation of how much you’ll pay to fix your out-of-commission water service line.

Water Service Line Diagnosis: $154
----------------------------------

Before any work can begin, the technician will need to come out and run some tests to see what’s wrong with your system. In Nevada, the fee for this is 31% lower than the national average.

Water Service Line Repair: $1,076
---------------------------------

A whole host of things can cause trouble with your exterior water service line — from invading tree roots to clogs to general wear and tear. Whatever’s up with your system, the repair process will likely start with excavation to expose the pipe. Depending on your situation, the technician may need to clear a blockage, find a leak or fix the pipe — and, of course, fill the hole back in.

Nevada’s average repair price is about 4% _more_ than the nation’s.

Water Service Line Replace: $3,015
----------------------------------

Small sections of leaky or broken pipe can be repaired, but massive clogs or fully compromised pipes might necessitate a full replacement. Water service line replacements cost Nevadans 16% less than the average American.
