Adding a pot filler can be as simple as installing a regular kitchen faucet. However, there are some other things to consider before taking on this job or hiring a plumber. Here’s a cost breakdown.

**What Is a Pot Filler Used For?**
----------------------------------

A pot filler, also called a pasta arm, is a specialized, high-volume faucet that's typically mounted on the wall about 16 inches (40 centimeters) above the stove. This feature lets homeowners quickly fill large pots for boiling pasta and making soups or stocks. This way, you can avoid the hassle of filling pots in the sink and carrying them across the kitchen. Most products have an unobtrusive, double-jointed design that lets them fold flat against the wall when they aren't in use. With all these benefits, it's easy to see why pot fillers have become commonplace in designer kitchens.

**How Much Does It Cost to Put in a Pot Filler?**
-------------------------------------------------

Pot filler installation costs depend on a variety of factors, including the type of fixture, the location of existing pipes and whether the wall has to be opened to accommodate new water lines and shutoff valves.

​​While some homeowners report paying as little as $300 (CAD 400) for the fixture, according to [Ferguson](https://www.ferguson.com/category/kitchen-plumbing/kitchen-bar-faucets/pot-fillers/_/N-zbq4ifZzbq7la?ADA_Compliant_fr=some&Application_fr=some&CEC_Compliant_fr=some&Cartridge_Type_fr=some&Collection_fr=some&Color_Finish_Category_fr=some&Faucet_Connection_Size_fr=some&Faucet_Connection_fr=some&Faucet_Material_fr=some&Faucet_Mount_fr=some&Flow_Rate_fr=some&Handle_Material_fr=some&Handle_Type_fr=some&Lead_Law_Compliant_fr=some&Number_of_Handles_fr=some&Number_of_Holes_fr=some&Spout_Height_fr=some&Spout_Reach_fr=some&Spout_Type_fr=some&Trim_Only_fr=some&_=1633022687690&brand_fr=some&searchKeyWord=pot+filler&sr=everywhere&typeAheadType=keyword), many residential products range from $450 to $800 (CAD 605 to CAD 1,075). High-end pot fillers may cost more than $1,200 (CAD 1,600). Other things that can affect the cost include the cartridge type, spout reach, flow rate and finish.

Installation costs for a pot filler vary just as widely as the cost of equipment. [Angi](https://www.angi.com/articles/pot-filler-over-stove.htm) reports the price to install a pot filler faucet can be up to $3,000 (CAD 4,000). One [design blogger](https://dianaelizabethblog.com/kitchen-pot-filler-installation-build-com/) said they spent about $550 (CAD 740) to have a plumber run a water line and connect the faucet once the tilework was complete.

**How Much Does It Cost to Add a Pot Filler to an Existing Kitchen?**
---------------------------------------------------------------------

There will likely be some additional expenses when adding a pot filler to an existing home. This job typically involves removing the existing drywall or tiled backsplash to run a new water line through the wall opening. A building permit is also required when modifying a home's plumbing system. This alone can increase the cost of the project by $50 to $150 (CAD 70 to CAD 210) or more, depending on the jurisdiction.

**Are Pot Fillers Worth It?**
-----------------------------

Kitchen upgrades can be a worthwhile investment. Some homeowners love their pot fillers, while others believe this seldom-used feature isn't worth the money. According to [Remodeling](https://www.remodeling.hw.net/cost-vs-value/2021/), major kitchen remodels have a 42% return on investment. More selective upgrades generate much higher returns. Whether a pasta arm is a “selective upgrade” in your case depends on where you live and other similar houses on the market in your area.

Ultimately, the decision of whether to install a pot filler is a personal one. Here are a few factors to consider.

*   Budget
*   Local plumbing rates
*   Design considerations
*   Plumbing access
*   Valve installation
*   Cooking style
*   Physical ability

Homeowners who feel that installing a pot filler is out of their budget can enjoy similar functionality by installing a kitchen faucet with a pot-filling feature. These commercial-style fixtures feature an additional high-flow spout for filling large pots. Plus, they generally have a pull-down sprayer that makes it easier to wash dishes and clean the sink.
