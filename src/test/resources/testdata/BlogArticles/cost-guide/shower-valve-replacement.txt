  There's something especially invigorating about taking a refreshing shower just after you wake up or at the end of a long day. When your shower isn't producing enough pressure, however, that spa-like experience can turn into a rather disappointing one.

If you've tried all the standard fixes and they haven't restored your shower to its former glory, replacing the shower valve could be the best solution. Shower valve replacement costs are usually far lower than buying an entirely new shower, yet this simple job can make your existing unit feel and perform as if it's brand new.

How Much Does It Cost to Replace a Shower Valve Cartridge?
----------------------------------------------------------

Replacing a shower valve is a relatively simple job. According to data from [Porch](https://porch.com/project-cost/cost-to-repair-a-shower-valve), you can expect to pay around $252 (CAD 334) for a valve replacement, or slightly more if you replace the whole unit.

Fees for replacing the whole shower valve average around $540 (CAD 717), with this price including the cost of the unit and labor. The cost of the valve itself is usually around $51 (CAD 68), so if you're a skilled DIYer, you may find it worth your time to complete the replacement yourself.

How Much Does a Plumber Charge to Install a Shower Valve?
---------------------------------------------------------

It takes around two hours to install a shower valve, assuming there’s already a shower installed. [Porch](https://porch.com/project-cost/cost-to-repair-a-shower-valve) says the fees for installing a shower valve typically run $340 (CAD 451) or more, depending on the type of valve and the cost of living in your zip code.

It's worth getting quotes from several plumbers to get an idea of the hourly rates in your area so you know how much you can expect to pay. While it's possible to do the job yourself, installing the valve is a moderately skilled job, so it's worth hiring a plumber if you don't have a lot of experience.

How Long Do Shower Valves Last?
-------------------------------

The shower valve assembly is a simple part that controls water pressure. Shower valves themselves don't really have a lot of moving parts. How long your valve will last depends on the type of shower you have, how hard your water is and whether the valve is a brass one or one with a cartridge.

The job of the shower valve is to control the water pressure. If the shower valve is installed incorrectly or the cartridge is worn, you may notice water coming out of your tub faucet at the same time as the shower is running. The water pressure out of the showerhead may not be as powerful as you’d expect.

A properly installed shower valve should serve you well for a long time. Even if you live in an area with hard water that causes limescale build-up in your appliances, you can expect to have a shower valve work well for about four or five years.
