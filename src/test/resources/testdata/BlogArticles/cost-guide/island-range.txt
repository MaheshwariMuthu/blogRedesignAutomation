  A kitchen island doesn't just make your kitchen look sleek — it can also add much-needed dining, cooking and preparation space. Furthermore, installing cooking appliances, sinks and outlets on your island can enhance its functionality.

Depending on the dimensions of your island, installing an island range could be an excellent option. Island ranges can make your kitchen more practical, but there are several cost factors to consider before taking the plunge.

How Much Does It Cost to Install an Island Range Without an Existing Electric Hookup?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

According to [LawnStarter](https://www.lawnstarter.com/blog/cost/kitchen-island-price/), installing an island range costs between $800 and $2,000 (CAD 1,062 and CAD 2,654) on average. Your project may cost more if you don't have electrical outlets installed on your kitchen island. Electricians typically charge around $200 (CAD 265) to install a new GFCI outlet, according to [Thumbtack](https://www.thumbtack.com/p/kitchen-island-cost#outlets), while new switches cost roughly $150 (CAD 199) each.

Depending on your range model, you may need to install a dedicated electrical circuit to supply your appliance. [HomeGuide](https://homeguide.com/costs/cost-to-install-a-dedicated-circuit) says the cost to add a dedicated circuit ranges between $250 and $900 (CAD 332 and CAD 1,194). Most people spend around $650 (CAD 863), including installation labor and materials.

Can You Install a Gas Range on a Kitchen Island?
------------------------------------------------

You can install a gas-powered island range, but it could be complex (and expensive) if you don't have a preexisting gas line. Connecting your home to the street [gas supply](https://homeguide.com/costs/gas-line-installation-cost) costs at least $2,000 (CAD 2,654). Therefore, installing an electric range is probably more economical unless you have a capped supply line ready to go. On the other hand, some homeowners prefer the precise heat control of a gas-powered hob.

Gas-powered ranges can pose a safety hazard unless they're adequately ventilated. For that reason, you'll need to install a range hood and ensure sufficient clearance around the island. Depending on the rules in your jurisdiction, you may also need to have a kitchen remodeling permit. Prices vary by area, but average costs range from $75 to $250 (CAD 100 to CAD 332).

Installing gas ranges requires expertise, and you should never attempt to install any gas appliance yourself because of the risk of fires and gas leaks. Instead, hire a professional plumber with experience installing gas ranges on kitchen islands.
