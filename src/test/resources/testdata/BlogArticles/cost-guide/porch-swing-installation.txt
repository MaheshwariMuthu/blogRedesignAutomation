  The thought of installing a swing on your porch brings to mind an idyllic scene for many homeowners: Imagine sitting on the porch swing at the end of a long day and watching the sunset unfold as you rock back and forth, sipping a cold drink. If you're a morning person, maybe you'd rather wrap up in a blanket, grab your coffee and head to the deck to catch the sunrise.

Luckily, installing a porch swing can be fairly affordable, so it's easy to make this particular dream a reality. For more specifics on pricing, read on.

**How Much Does Porch Swing Installation Cost?**
------------------------------------------------

The cost of installing a porch swing depends mostly on what type of swing you want and what it's made from. Basic and smaller porch swings tend to be cheaper than larger, more elaborate options. Rope porch swings are usually less expensive than wood bench options.

How you need to mount the swing — and whether you need a frame to hang it on — is another concern in terms of price. If you want to finish or seal a wood swing, that may also increase the total cost.

**Types of Porch Swings**
-------------------------

The biggest factor impacting the cost of any porch swing installation is the swing itself. Here’s what each type costs:

### Prefabricated Wood Bench-Style Swing

Depending on the size and quality of the swing, you might pay anywhere from [$60 to $1,000 or more](https://home.costhelper.com/porch-swing.html) (CAD 80 to CAD 1,350) for a standard bench-style swing. You can purchase premade wooden swings from home improvement, hardware and garden stores.

### Plastic Swing

Not all porch swings are wood. [Plastic or resin options](https://www.lowes.com/pl/Plastic--Porch-swings-gliders-Swings-gliders-Patio-furniture-Outdoors/4294610445?refinement=530721447) cost $350 to $550 (CAD 470 to CAD 735), depending on size, style and color.

### Rope Swing

Macrame hanging chair swings are some of the least expensive options. You can find them for sale for [$50 to $300](https://www.wayfair.com/keyword.php?keyword=macrame+hanging+chair) (CAD 70 to CAD 400), with the actual price dependent on the swing’s style, size and features.

### Custom Options

If you pay someone to make a porch swing to your exact specifications, it'll cost between $200 and $2,000 (CAD 270 and CAD 2,700). The cost will depend on the type of wood you want and how big the swing is. For example, a custom bench swing will be a lot less expensive than a large swing meant to hold a twin mattress.

### DIY

If you’re skilled at woodworking (or if you have some basic tools), you can make a porch swing yourself. You can buy kits with precut pieces or simply purchase the wood and follow a DIY tutorial. Depending on the wood you choose, the price for a DIY swing ranges from $150 to $1,000 (CAD 200 to CAD 1,350).

**Can You Hang a Porch Swing Yourself?**
----------------------------------------

Yes. Hanging a porch swing is a relatively straightforward task in most cases. Most people don't hire a professional to handle this type of job, though the work is typically easier if you have someone to help you. You may also need a drill to complete the installation.

If you're installing an oversized porch swing, or if you're not sure your patio or deck roof can hold the weight of a swing, you may want to consult a contractor or someone with construction experience.

**Other Factors That Influence Cost**
-------------------------------------

How you install the swing will impact the overall cost. Here are some things to consider when budgeting for your porch swing installation:

### Chains or Ropes

What will hold the swing up? Chains are more expensive than rope, but they're durable and can hold more weight. You'll need to buy enough chain to safely hold the swing at the desired height and allow for some movement.

### Frame

If you don't have a structure from which to hang the swing, you may need to buy or build a frame. The swing is then hung from this frame rather than a roof or rafters. Frames can cost as much as or more than the swing itself, depending on size, materials and other factors.

### Hooks and Hardware

You'll need hooks and other hardware to mount the chains and hook them in place to hold the swing. This is typically the least expensive part of installing a swing.

### Finish or Paint

If you make or purchase a wood swing, you might want to paint it or apply a finish. While many porch swings are made of pretreated lumber, finishing the product yourself can allow you to match it to the aesthetic of your porch. Painting or finishing can also help protect the swing from the elements.
