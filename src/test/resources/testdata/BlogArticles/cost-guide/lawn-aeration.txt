  If your family enjoys spending time outside, you probably use your yard regularly. However, heavy traffic can lead to soil compaction and an unhealthy lawn. If your lawn is looking tired, it may be time to aerate. Lawn aeration — also known as core aeration — is the process of breaking up compacted soil and thatch to allow air, water and nutrients to reach the root zone.

This relatively simple lawn maintenance task makes a great weekend DIY project. Or, you can hire a professional lawn care company to do the job. Average costs can be anywhere from $25 (CAD 34) all the way up to several hundred dollars. Costs depend on the tools used, the size of the lawn and whether you do the project yourself. Let’s take a look at average lawn aeration costs for both DIY and professional services.

DIY Lawn Aeration Costs
-----------------------

If you aerate your lawn yourself, you won’t have to pay for labor, but you will have to buy or rent an aerator. According to [HomeGuide](https://homeguide.com/costs/lawn-aeration-cost#buy), purchasing your own lawn aerator costs between $100 and $400 (CAD 135 and CAD 540) on average. Some handheld lawn aerators cost as little as $20 (CAD 27), while a manual push spike aerator costs between $40 and $130 (CAD 57 and CAD 175). Expect to pay between $100 and $400 (CAD 135 and CAD 540) for a tow-behind plug or spike aerator.

If you’d prefer to rent equipment, it's available at most large home improvement stores and equipment rental centers. [Bob Vila](https://www.bobvila.com/articles/lawn-aeration-cost/) says Lawn aerator rental costs vary by retailer, but they tend to run about $90 (CAD 120) for the entire day. You’ll also have to leave a deposit of around $150 (CAD 200), which is usually refundable as long as the equipment is returned on time and in good condition.

### Additional DIY Considerations

DIYers may have several other expenses, depending on the scope of their project, including the cost of seed and fertilizer. [Lawn Love](https://lawnlove.com/blog/cost-to-seed-lawn/#diy) estimates the average cost of overseeding a lawn at around $650 to $1,650 (CAD 880 to CAD 2,240). If you need to rent a truck to transport equipment, be sure to factor that cost into your budget as well.

Professional Lawn Aeration Costs
--------------------------------

If you hire a lawn care company to do the job, they may charge by the hour or the square foot. Or, they may set a flat rate for every quarter acre. Professional lawn aeration service costs, on average, about $7 to $25 (CAD 9.50 to CAD 34) per thousand square feet.  For a 5,000-square-foot lawn, that adds up to between $50 and $150. Companies that charge an hourly rate usually want $30 to $70 (CAD 40 to CAD 95) per hour, so the total cost can vary depending on the size of the yard and the job's complexity.

### How Much Does It Cost to Aerate 1 Acre?

Some companies charge a flat rate of about $55 to $115 (CAD 75 to CAD 155) per quarter acre, regardless of the job's complexity. You'll typically pay between $130 and $250 (CAD 175 and 340) for a full acre of land.

### How Much Does Aeration and Overseeding Cost?

If your lawn is damaged, combining aeration with overseeding and fertilizing can help restore your grassy areas. If you opt to have it done by a lawn care company, the overall cost would be about $160 to $425 (CAD 215 to CAD 575) for 10,000 square feet of lawn.

Is Aerating Your Lawn Worth It?
-------------------------------

For a relatively small cost, lawn aeration can improve your lawn's health. But it isn’t always necessary to do it annually. Most healthy lawns should be aerated about every two to three years, [The Spruce](https://www.thespruce.com/when-and-how-do-you-aerate-your-grass-2130974) says. However, if your lawn grows in heavy soil or experiences heavy foot traffic, annual aeration may be beneficial. It may also be helpful to aerate your soil prior to laying sod.
