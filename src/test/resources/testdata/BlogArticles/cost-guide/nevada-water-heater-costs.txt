  While Nevada is, indeed, covered in desert, and it _does_ get awfully hot there at certain times of the year, that doesn’t make a working water heater worth less than its weight in gold in the Silver State. Taking comfortable showers and doing laundry requires the same amount of hot water in the Great Basin as it does anywhere else — but finding yourself without any when coming in from a summer’s dust storm is gonna make it feel more like the _grit_ basin. Before you start yelling “Hoover Dam!” you may be relieved to know that Nevada residents, generally speaking, pay quite a bit less than the average American for water heater repair and replacement.

Your water heater powers your dishwasher, clothes washer and the hot shower you crave at the end of the day. When it goes kaput, it's not so much a matter of _whether_ you should have it serviced, but how much that service will cost. And if your hot water is already out, the last thing you want right now is to be blindsided by exorbitant water heater service fees. If you’re calling around for estimates, these figures should give you a ballpark idea of how much you can expect to pay, from Lake Tahoe to the Colorado River.

Repair and replacement costs vary depending on where you live. For comparison, the national average for diagnosis is $99, for repair is $493 and for replacement is $1,741.

The following average prices are based on aggregated HomeServe data reported by our network of contractors across the state of Nevada:

Water Heater Diagnosis: $59
---------------------------

The technician will charge you a fee to come out to your home, tell you what’s wrong with your system and determine whether it needs to be repaired or replaced. For Nevadans at large‚ this fee is 40% less than the national average.

Water Heater Repair: $197
-------------------------

Any number of things may be going wrong with your water heater — issues with the gas control valve, a faulty thermostat or a combination of several malfunctions. This estimated repair price includes replacement parts and the labor to install them. Water heater repairs cost the average Nevada resident a whopping 60% less than they do nationwide.

Water Heater Replace: $1,421
----------------------------

Water heaters don’t last forever, and a breakdown might be a sign that yours is on its way out. At the end of your water heater’s usable life (about 10 years), you'll need to spring for a new one. Nevada's average replacement price is roughly 18% less than that of the nation.

(Note that HomeServe water heater data should generally be assumed to refer to conventional “tanked” models — the most common type — as opposed to tankless or “on-demand” models, which can cost roughly twice as much.)
