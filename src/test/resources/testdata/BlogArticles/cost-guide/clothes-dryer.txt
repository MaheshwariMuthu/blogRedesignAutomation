Explore this price breakdown based on different types of dryers and the features they offer.

How Much Does a Dryer Cost?
---------------------------

According to [HomeGuide](https://homeguide.com/costs/washer-and-dryer-cost), the typical price range for dryers spans from $800 to $1,200 (CAD 1,075 to CAD 1,613). Plan to pay about double that if you're also buying a new washing machine because washers cost around the same amount. You might also have additional installation expenses if your current setup doesn't work for your new dryer.

Factors in the pricing include the size of the dryer, the power source and the extra features you choose.

### Budget Models

If your focus is price, a budget model is an affordable option that will cost between $400 and $800 (CAD 538 and CAD 1,075). This option is good for an extra dryer, a first home or low-use situations where you don't care about extra features. The cheapest dryers typically have plastic drums, manual dial controls to toggle between three temperature settings and very few cycle options.

### Mid-Range Models

With a slightly larger budget, you can get a mid-range dryer costing between $800 and $1,200 (CAD 1,075 and CAD 1,613). This usually upgrades you to a durable stainless steel drum with a larger capacity than the base models. You'll find a wide range of gas and electric dryers in this pricing group, often with more cycles and settings. Some might have electronic controls at this higher price point.

### High-End Models

The most expensive options have high-end features to match the higher price tag, starting at around $1,200 (CAD 1,075) and topping out at about $2,300 (CAD 3,092). They typically have the most cycles and setting options available, giving you more variety for drying clothes.

Other features you might find on high-end dryers include:

*   Wi-Fi connectivity that lets you control the dryer from anywhere using an app
*   Alerts and monitoring options from the app
*   Electronic or touchscreen controls
*   Noise-reduction features for quieter operation
*   Moisture sensors to set the cycle length automatically
*   Lint cleaning alerts when the lint trap is full
*   Steam dry settings
*   Remote diagnostics options to troubleshoot at home without calling a technician
*   Connection to virtual home assistant devices for voice-activated controls
*   Upgraded finishes in various colors
*   Premium design features that make the dryer look upscale

Every extra feature adds to the overall price of the dryer. When comparing the options, consider which features you really need or want and which ones are an unnecessary expense.

What's the Price Difference Between Gas and Electric Dryers?
------------------------------------------------------------

Gas dryers cost more initially than electric dryers. According to [Bob Vila](https://www.bobvila.com/articles/gas-vs-electric-dryers/), the price difference is usually about $100 (CAD 134) more for a gas dryer compared to a similar electric model. For example, mid-range electric dryers usually cost between $400 and $600 (CAD 538 and CAD 807), but you might pay between $500 and $750 (CAD 672 and CAD 1,008) for gas dryers.

However, gas dryers are usually cheaper to operate. That's because gas is generally cheaper than electricity. On average, you'll pay about 15 to 25 cents (CAD 0.20 to CAD 0.34) to dry a load of laundry in a gas dryer. That same load would cost approximately 30 to 40 cents (CAD 0.40 to CAD 0.54) to dry in an electric dryer. Gas dryers also dry your clothes faster because they provide instant heat.

The cheapest option is to replace an existing dryer with one that uses the same power source. If you switch from gas to electric or vice versa, you'll likely need to have a technician install the correct power source in your laundry room, which increases the installation price significantly.

How Much Does It Cost to Install a Dryer?
-----------------------------------------

If you're simply moving your old dryer out and putting the new one in using the existing connections, the installation should cost around $100 to $300 (CAD 134 to CAD 403) to cover the labor. If you have the installer move and dispose of your old dryer, [LawnStarter](https://www.lawnstarter.com/blog/cost/junk-removal-price/) says it could add $50 to $150 (CAD 67 to CAD 202) to the price. For new dryer vents, you'll pay an extra $100 to $800 (CAD 134 to CAD 1,075), according to [HomeGuide](https://homeguide.com/costs/dryer-vent-installation-cost).

If you're switching to a different power source or don't currently have a dryer in the home, you might need to hire a licensed contractor to prepare for the dryer. An electric dryer typically requires a 240-volt outlet with a special plug. If you don't have one, [HomeGuide](https://homeguide.com/costs/electrician-cost-per-hour) says you'll pay $50 to $130 (CAD 67 to CAD 175) an hour for an electrician to install one and do other electrical work to accommodate the dryer.

For a gas dryer, you'll need a plumber if there isn't already a gas line to the laundry room. The [typical hourly rate](https://homeguide.com/costs/plumber-cost) is between $45 and $150 (CAD 60 and CAD 202) for this work, and [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/home-improvement/plumbing/gas-line-installation-repair-cost/) says new gas lines usually run between $30 and $75 (CAD 40 and CAD 101) per linear foot.

You can also buy conversion kits to switch between propane and natural gas as the dryer power source. The cost of a conversion kit depends on the brand and type, with prices starting at around $17 (CAD 23) from [The Home Depot](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Outdoors-Outdoor-Cooking-Grill-Replacement-Parts-Conversion-Kits/Conversion-Kit/N-5yc1vZbxdmZ1z0v8ef).

How Many Years Does a Dryer Last?
---------------------------------

[Sears Home Services](https://www.searshomeservices.com/blog/how-long-do-appliances-usually-last) says most clothes dryers last 10 to 13 years when well-maintained. If you have a large family and do lots of laundry, your dryer likely won't last as long as it would for a single person who doesn’t produce a lot of dirty clothes. Keeping the dryer properly vented and free of lint helps it run efficiently and reduces strain on the appliance, which can extend its life. Having a professional make repairs if the dryer has minor issues can also help keep it going for years.
