  No matter what steps you take to lower your monthly energy bills, [long-term trends](https://www.statista.com/statistics/201714/growth-in-us-residential-electricity-prices-since-2000/) suggest that energy prices will continue to rise. One of the many ways you can reduce energy waste is properly insulating your home. Most homeowners immediately think of insulating spaces like the attic or wall cavities. But did you know that another area of the home that quietly bleeds money is the garage?

You can lose a lot of heated or cooled air through your garage door, even when it’s closed. Then your furnace or air conditioner has to work harder to keep up, bumping up your energy bills. Insulated garage doors can help with climate control. So, how much does an insulated garage door cost? We've got your answer.

How Much Does It Cost to Have an Insulated Garage Door Installed?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

There are a number of factors that may affect the final cost, including whether you decide to upgrade your existing garage door or replace it with an insulated model. Other factors include the size of the door, its material, the contractor's pricing structure and the removal of the old door. The design of the door also affects the cost, particularly if you decide to include additional features, such as windows or more expensive insulating materials. You can save money by installing the insulation yourself — but beware that this may only save money in the short term if the job isn't done well.

According to [Fixr](https://www.fixr.com/costs/install-garage-door#insulated-garage-doors-pricing), the average price for a basic steel door for a one-car garage is about $600 (CAD 770). Upgrading the door to a vinyl model would cost around $800 (CAD 1,000). Add in the labor costs to remove the existing garage door and install the new one, and you can expect to pay between $700 and $2,300 (CAD 900 and CAD 3,000) from start to finish.

Polystyrene or Polyurethane?
----------------------------

This is really a question of whether you do the project yourself or buy a professionally insulated garage door.

Polystyrene is the insulating material used in kits sold by retailers. You can cut the material into shape and insert it between the layers of your door. Although this is the more affordable of the two options, it's also the least effective form of insulation, which may not do as much in the way of lowering your energy bills.

Polyurethane foam is sprayed in between the panels during the manufacturing process, which ensures every corner of the door is insulated. It costs more up front because you'll have to buy and install a new door. However, it can save money in the long run because it's more efficient at stopping heat from exiting or entering through your garage.

The big question — how much an insulated garage door costs — can't be answered without considering the insulation’s R-value. According to the [Department of Energy](https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/insulation), R-value is a measure of thermal resistance, or how well an insulating material prevents heat from invading or escaping. The higher the R-number of the garage door, the better the insulation and the greater the cost.

Other Costs to Consider
-----------------------

### Brand

If you’re thinking about purchasing an insulated garage door, it’s best to compare brands to make sure you’re getting the best price. Popular brands typically compete with one another on price.

### Material

Your choice of material will make a big difference when it comes to the final bill, regardless of the manufacturer. Choose from an array of styles manufactured with artificial and natural materials, such as vinyl and wood.

If you choose a steel door, the thickness will also affect its cost. Single-layer doors cost between [$500 and $1,200](https://www.remodelingcalculator.org/steel-garage-doors/) (CAD 650 to CAD 1,550), but they’re not insulated. Double-layer doors usually have some polystyrene insulation and range in cost from $800 to $1,800 (CAD 1,000 to CAD 2,300). Triple-layer and customized garage doors cost at least $1,000, and you could pay over $3,000 (CAD 3,850) for a premium model. However, these have the best built-in insulation.

### Maintenance

When calculating the costs of upgrading or installing a garage door, it's easy to forget to think beyond the installation. For example, that cedar door may look great, but it needs to be painted regularly or it won't last as long as it should. Additionally, wood is heavier than most door materials. It will need a trolley that's up to the job. Aluminum and steel doors may not need the same amount of maintenance as other alternatives, but they could be expensive to repair if they are dented or damaged.
