  Televisions used to take up a large amount of floor space. They were big, heavy pieces of tech that basically controlled any room they inhabited. But thanks to the advances in technology over the years, TVs are now flat and thin. They’re small enough to be unobtrusive, instead of monolithic obstructions that dominate the room — and they’re just the right size to be mounted to the wall.

If you’re not too keen on mounting your own television, you can pay for the service. Here, we’ve broken down the associated costs so you know what to expect.

How Much Does It Cost to Mount a TV?
------------------------------------

Typically, the price to have your TV mounted and installed by a professional falls within the $158 to $360 (CAD 221 to CAD 481) range, according to [Bob Vila](https://www.bobvila.com/articles/tv-mount-installation-cost/). The actual price varies depending on a few scenarios, such as materials, labor and how complicated the installation process is. The process changes based on the type of mount, the place you want to mount it and the overall size and weight of the TV. If you have plaster walls or a very tight space, expect to pay more.

The price also changes if you’re going to do it yourself. The only cost of installation if you do it yourself is the cost of the mounting hardware. When hiring a professional, you’ll be paying for both the materials and labor.

Cost of TV Mounts
-----------------

There are a variety of mounts available for your TV. Some keep it flat against the wall, while others have tilting mounts. You can also get mounts with a full range of motion, which let you turn the TV in any direction. You are only limited by the free space you have available to mount the TV.

It's important to make sure the mount is the right fit for your TV. Some have different features that make them incompatible with certain TVs, and some have different weight restrictions. Here are some of the most common mounts:

### Flat Mounts

Flatter mounts require less room and are often the cheapest option because their installation is less involved. Flat mounts tend to begin around $75 (CAD 100), including installation, and go up from there depending on the size and weight of the TV being installed. The bigger and heavier the TV, the more expensive the mount, so keep that in mind.

### Tilt Mounts

The next step up in terms of price is the tilting mount. A general rule of thumb: The more moving parts there are, the more expensive it will be. It’ll also be that much more difficult to install. Tilting mounts cost up to $500 (CAD 669) with professional installation, with costs based on size, weight and degree of tilt.

### Full-Motion Mounts

Full-motion mounts are the mounting option with the most flexibility. They let you position your TV in more custom configurations than the other styles. Prices for these can reach $700 (CAD 936) for the mount itself, which can have a considerable weight to them without the TV, and installation labor. The weight of the TV can also increase installation costs.

Mounting Your Flatscreen
------------------------

When deciding to mount the TV yourself, there are a few considerations to keep in mind. The first is the space you’ll be using. You need to make sure the TV can fit in the intended area and, more importantly, that the space can sustain it. Here’s what else you should keep in mind:

### Where to Mount

The most common place to mount a TV is on a wall. But they can also be mounted to ceilings, doors, decorative partitions and other types of fixtures. Essentially, if you have a surface that the TV fits, there’s a mounting solution. This is important because the mounting costs for both DIY and professional installation can increase depending on the material of the mounting surface.

### Weight Considerations

TVs are significantly lighter than they were even a decade ago, but this is still a considerable amount of weight to have hanging on a wall. Some surfaces, like drywall, can’t handle the weight of the TV on their own and need reinforcement or other solutions. Others, like brick, will be able to handle the weight but require a special process and tools for mounting. Each of these variations changes the complexity and price of the job.

### Wiring and Accessories

There are also other labor costs associated with installation that could drive up your price, such as wiring or mounting your accessories. Be it cable and satellite boxes, gaming systems, streaming devices or surround-sound systems, you need to find a way to account for the peripherals associated with your TV. Depending on your budget and the space, it’s worth considering adding those in when the TV is mounted.

### Cost of Labor

In most cases, the labor will take a couple of hours. This can make the standard labor cost for the simplest jobs anywhere from $60 to $200 (CAD 80 to CAD 267)﻿ in addition to the mount.

The price for labor on professional installations in most instances isn’t excessive, but you can cut costs by doing it yourself. If you have a complicated room setup, a lot of accessories or you just don't feel comfortable with installing large fixtures, it might be worth it to pay for the extra help. Plus, it's always a good idea to make sure you have professionals on call in the event of the unexpected.
