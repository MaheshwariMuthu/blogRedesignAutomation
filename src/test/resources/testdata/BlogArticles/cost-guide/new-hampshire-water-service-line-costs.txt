Lake Winnipesaukee is a fun place to spend the summer, though most New Hampshirites wouldn’t attempt to approximate the experience in their yard. Still, a lawn lake is what one could wind up with if a winter deep freeze or rogue roots run afoul of their home’s [water service line](https://www.homeserve.com/en-us/blog/home-improvement/exterior-water-service-lines-explained/). Like pretty much everyone else, Granite Staters likely take their underground pipes for _granite_ (sorry, we couldn’t resist) — but in the event something does go wrong down there, they may find themselves between a rock and a hard place. That’s because, on average, New Hampshire homeowners pay significantly more for water line repair and replacement than their fellow Americans.

Your exterior water service line carries water from the public water main into your home. But make no mistake: Once the pipes run under your property, they’re _your_ responsibility — so you’re likely on the hook for any repair or replacement costs.

How deep your pipes are buried deeply impacts the price you pay for these services. Water service lines are buried as deep as local building codes require — but usually, the depth is determined by the frost line in your area. And the deeper the technician must dig to get to your broken or otherwise compromised line, the higher the cost.

The nationwide average water service line depth is 4.58 feet. In New Hampshire, these lines are buried about half a foot deeper than that, at 5.0 feet on average. For context, in _f-f-f-freezing_ Minnesota, pipe depth is more than _8_ feet.

Repair and replacement costs also vary depending on where you live. The national average for diagnosis is $222, for repair is $1,039 and for replacement is $3,581.

Below, you’ll find average service prices based on aggregated HomeServe data reported by our network of contractors across New Hampshire, which should give you an approximation of how much you’ll pay to fix your out-of-commission water service line.

Water Service Line Diagnosis
----------------------------

Before any work can begin, the technician will need to come out and run some tests to see what’s wrong with your system. We didn’t have sufficient data to provide an average diagnosis cost for New Hampshire, so budget in the national average of $222.

Water Service Line Repair: $1,254
---------------------------------

A whole host of things can cause trouble with your exterior water service line — from invading tree roots to clogs to general wear and tear. Whatever’s up with your system, the repair process will likely start with excavation to expose the pipe. Depending on your situation, the technician may need to clear a blockage, find a leak or fix the pipe — and, of course, fill the hole back in.

New Hampshire’s average repair price is about 21% _higher_ than the nation’s.

Water Service Line Replace: $5,809
----------------------------------

Small sections of leaky or broken pipe can be repaired, but massive clogs or fully compromised pipes might necessitate a full replacement. Due in part to how deep your pipes are buried, water service line replacements cost New Hampshirites a whopping 62% more than the average American.
