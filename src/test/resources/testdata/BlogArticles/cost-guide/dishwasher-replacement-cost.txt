  Nothing is more frustrating than finishing up a tasty meal and realizing you have stacks of dishes to handle. A dishwasher can help cut down on your chore time, and they actually use way less water than hand-washing dishes. (Who knew?)

Some people put off getting a dishwasher because they're worried about costs. The good news is that a dishwasher is one of the least expensive kitchen appliances out there. You can actually find models that just cost a few hundred dollars, and labor for installation isn't too pricey, either.

Getting an idea of dishwasher installation costs can help you plan ahead and find options that suit your budget.

Typical Dishwasher Installation Costs
-------------------------------------

When looking at dishwasher installation, there are a few different costs to consider. The biggest investment will be for the cost of the appliance itself. According to [HomeGuide](https://homeguide.com/costs/dishwasher-cost#:~:text=A%20new%20dishwasher%20costs%20%24400,to%20%24500%20for%20countertop%20models.), there's a pretty big range in dishwasher prices. A budget countertop dishwasher could cost as little as $250 to $500 (CAD 341 to CAD 683), while a standard 24-inch model could set you back $400 to $1,200 (CAD 546 to CAD 1,639) or more.

The next thing to look at when calculating your dishwasher installation costs is the price of the labor. Many homeowners will need a professional to come and hook up their dishwashers to water supplies, drain lines and electrical outlets. [HomeGuide](https://homeguide.com/costs/dishwasher-installation-cost#:~:text=by%20HomeGuide%20members-,Average%20labor%20cost%20to%20install%20a%20dishwasher,hour%20for%20a%20simple%20replacement.) says you should expect to pay around $150 to $350 (CAD 205 to CAD 478) in labor costs to install your new dishwasher, although it could cost as much as $300 to $1,300 (CAD 410 to CAD 1,775) if you require extra plumbing or electrical work.

Factors That Increase Dishwasher Installation Costs
---------------------------------------------------

Dishwasher installation costs vary so much because of the wide range of available features. Pricier models tend to have a lot of high-tech options, such as custom-wash cycles and smartphone-syncing capability. In some cases, you may be paying extra for style, with trendier top control designs or unusual colors resulting in higher price tags.

A more functional reason for cost differences is the materials the dishwasher is made from. A major difference between dishwasher models is whether the interior is made of plastic or stainless steel. Dishwashers made of metal are better able to resist corrosion and high heat, and metal also results in a quieter and more energy-efficient washer.

When hiring someone to install the dishwasher, it's important to ensure they're familiar with some of these features. You want the dishwasher installed correctly and ready to operate as soon as the job is done. Some professionals may charge more for extra services that will get you there.

So, How Much Should You Spend on Dishwasher Installation?
---------------------------------------------------------

Dishwashers are one of those home improvements where you shouldn't go for the cheapest option. In some cases, the most affordable dishwashers break down quickly or don't wash dishes thoroughly. By investing in a quality dishwasher, you can get an appliance that will last about seven to 12 years, on average.

This doesn't necessarily mean you need to spend $3,500 (CAD 4,779) on a premium brand. It just means you may want to pay a little extra to get a higher-quality model. Dishwashers in the range of $800 to $1,200 (CAD 1,092 to CAD 1,639) typically offer the ideal combination of quality and budget-friendliness. If you want to save, skip on nonessential features, such as auto-run cycles, and just pay extra for a stainless-steel tub, which makes for a more durable machine.
