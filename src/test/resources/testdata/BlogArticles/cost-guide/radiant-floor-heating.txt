Installing these systems is a major project, so it's worth understanding how much radiant floor heating costs before committing. Below, you can find out how much you should expect to pay for different types of heated floor systems. 

What Is Radiant Floor Heating?
------------------------------

Radiant floor heating is a system installed under the floor that generates radiant heat. These systems are usually more efficient than other home heating methods because they heat your furniture and the air around you instead of warming all the air inside your home. You can generally have your thermostat lower in a home with radiant floor heating because it warms you directly. 

Radiant floor heating systems are usually cheaper to run than traditional heating systems because they use less energy. Various system types are available that circulate warm air or water through pipes below the floor or heat the floor using electrical cables. 

Some homeowners choose to replace their entire heating system and install radiant floor heating in every room. Alternatively, you can install smaller systems in single rooms and use your existing system to heat the rest of the house. 

How Much Does Radiant Floor Heating Cost to Install?
----------------------------------------------------

How much radiant floor heating costs to install depends on several factors, including the system type and how accessible the room is. According to [Bob Vila](https://www.bobvila.com/articles/radiant-floor-heating-cost/), the average cost to install a radiant floor heating system in your home is around $3,900 (CAD 5,100), although prices vary between $1,700 and $6,000 (CAD 2,200 and CAD 7,800). 

The materials for installing a radiant floor heating system are relatively inexpensive, generally costing between $1.50 and $2 (CAD 2 to CAD 3) per square foot.

Labor is the most expensive part of installing your new heating system, and you should expect to pay a contractor between $8 and $12 (CAD 10 to CAD 15) per square foot. 

### Installation Costs by Room

Installing your system in a kitchen is usually the most affordable option, costing between $1,900 and $5,500 (CAD 2,500 and CAD 7,200) on average.

Meanwhile, radiant floor heating costs between $2,500 and $7,500 (CAD 3,300 and CAD 9,800) to install in a bathroom.

Upgrading your basement heating system to radiant floor heating is often the most expensive because it involves removing concrete. Expect to pay up to $31,000 (CAD 40,000) to install basement radiant floor heating.

How Much Does Whole-House Radiant Floor Heating Cost?
-----------------------------------------------------

Installing whole-house radiant heating is an expensive project. How much you pay depends on factors, such as the size of your home, the going rate for labor in your area and whether you need to install a boiler. 

According to [Fixr](https://www.fixr.com/costs/install-radiant-floor-heating), it costs around $28,000 (CAD 36,500) to install radiant floor heating with two zones and a new boiler in a 2,000-square-foot home. However, the price varies based on the type of system you install. You might pay anywhere from $20,000 to $35,000 (CAD 26,000 to CAD 46,000), depending on if you want a simple, single-zone system, or a three-zone system with upgraded insulation.

What Are the Different Types of Radiant Floor Heating?
------------------------------------------------------

### Hydronic

The most affordable option is usually a hydronic system that circulates hot water through pipes under the floor. Installing hydronic radiant floor heating usually costs between $10 and $16 (CAD 13 to CAD 21) per square foot. 

### Radiant Air

Alternatively, radiant air heating systems use solar energy to heat air and pump it continuously under the floor. These systems cost between $14 and $20 (CAD 18 to CAD 26) installed, although you'll also need to install solar panels. Adding solar panels will increase the cost of your project by around [$18,000](https://www.fixr.com/costs/solar-panel-installation) (CAD 23,500).

### Electric

Electric radiant flooring is usually the most expensive type to install and run, costing between $16 and $25 (CAD 21 to CAD 33) per square foot. Some electric floor heating systems use heated mats installed under the flooring, while others use loose heated cables in a grid. Mat systems are more affordable and straightforward to install than loose cable systems and are common in small spaces, such as bathrooms.
