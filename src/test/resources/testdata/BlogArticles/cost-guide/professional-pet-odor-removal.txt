  Your precious pup or feline friend had an accident on your carpet, and you weren’t right there to clean up the mess immediately. Once it soaks in, the odor seems like it's a permanent fixture in your home — and urine isn't the only scent pets can leave.

Whether you've moved into a home once occupied by pets or your furry family members have created an aroma that's less-than-desirable, professional odor removal may be the best solution.

What Do Odor Removal Companies Charge?
--------------------------------------

Odor removal service costs depend on a variety of factors, including how stubborn the odors are and the size of the area that needs to be cleaned. According to [Fixr](https://www.fixr.com/costs/pet-odor-removal-service#pet-odor-removal-service-cost), most professional services charge $150 to $250 (CAD 190 to CAD 320) per visit. Preferences such as environmentally friendly cleaning options or zero-chemical processes tend to drive the price up to the higher end of that spectrum.

How Much Does It Cost to Deodorize a House?
-------------------------------------------

If you're looking at professional pet odor removal solutions for your entire house, the cost can range from around $900 to $1,250 (CAD 1,150 to CAD 1,600). The total price depends on the size of your home, the area where you live and the type of deodorizing solution you want.

Will Professional Carpet Cleaning Remove Pet Odors?
---------------------------------------------------

Typically, the pet odors that linger in your carpet come from more than one source. Urine can seep below the surface of the carpet and into the underpadding below. It's not just the urine that smells; mold and mildew can grow due to the trapped moisture, and this can create its own odor. Bacteria left behind by your pets can also generate an odor.

Whether or not professional carpet cleaning can remove pet odors depends on whether they can remove the odor-causing elements. Professional solutions do much more than the simple cleaning you can do with your vacuum or even a store-bought carpet cleaner. This is often enough to reduce or remove pet odors.

Does Steam Cleaning Remove Pet Urine?
-------------------------------------

Steam cleaning doesn't always remove pet urine. In fact, according to the [Humane Society](https://www.humanesociety.org/resources/how-remove-pet-stains-and-odors), the heat involved in the process of steam cleaning can cause stains and odors to set in permanently. This is because the proteins in the urine can become bonded to certain manufactured fibers under that level of heat.

What’s the Best Pet Odor Neutralizer?
-------------------------------------

This really depends on your preferences. Go-to home cleaning supplies such as ammonia or full-strength vinegar are not always ideal for this purpose. They may get the stain and odor out of the carpet, but the [Humane Society](https://www.humanesociety.org/resources/how-remove-pet-stains-and-odors) notes that the strong chemical scent of such products can cause pets to continue to urinate on those areas to reinforce their own scent mark.

[Great Pet Care](https://www.greatpetcare.com/pet-cleaning/best-pet-odor-eliminators/) recommends using enzymatic neutralizers and cleaners. These use enzymes to break down the odor-causing particles. Great Pet Care also notes that you should avoid odor removal solutions that include chemicals such as bleach, phenols, formaldehyde or isopropyl alcohol, as these can be bad for your pet's health. You might also want to invest in solutions that freshen the air inside your home to help battle pet odor.

How Do You Make Homemade Pet Odor Remover?
------------------------------------------

Before you pay for a professional dog or cat odor removal service, you might want to try a DIY approach. Here are a few options:

### Borax and Vinegar

Mix equal parts borax, white vinegar and salt. This makes a paste you can scrub into the area. When it's completely dry, vacuum it up.

### Baking Soda

Spread some dry baking soda over the area. Let it sit for up to 24 hours, then vacuum.

### Lavender Essential Oil

If you want to use a vinegar-based cleaning solution, follow up with a few drops of lavender oil to neutralize both the pet and vinegar odors.
