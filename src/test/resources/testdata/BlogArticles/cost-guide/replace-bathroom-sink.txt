Is bathroom sink installation something you want to tackle on your own, or should you hire a professional? Understanding the costs involved should help you make a decision.

Reasons to Replace Your Bathroom Sink
-------------------------------------

People replace bathroom sinks for many reasons, but the "why" behind this small bathroom reno task can actually impact the cost of installation.

### Damage

Perhaps the kids smashed it one too many times with hard toys and there's a crack, or maybe time has worn away the protective glaze. Replacing the sink, in this case, can help reduce functionality issues or leaks.

### Mold or Mildew

An ill-fitting sink or one that's damaged could support mold or mildew growth. Tiny leaks, seeps or problems draining, for example, can spur such problems on. You’ll likely have to fix this problem before you can install a new sink, which may add to the total cost.

### It’s Upgrade Time

If you want a more functional faucet or bathroom vanity, you may wish to replace the bathroom sink. Or maybe you just think the existing sink is ugly. You're tired of looking at an eyesore every time you brush your teeth, or you've redecorated the rest of the bathroom, and it's time for the sink to catch up.

Average Cost to Replace a Bathroom Sink
---------------------------------------

According to [HomeGuide](https://homeguide.com/costs/sink-installation-cost#breplace), the average cost for replacing a sink runs from $280 to $1,200 (CAD 360 to CAD 1,550), including materials and labor.

[The Home Depot](https://www.homedepot.com/services/c/sink-installation/1faf84442), for example, charges $200 to $350 (CAD 260 to CAD 450) to install a sink, though that doesn't include the cost of the sink, faucet or any related plumbing work that might need to be done. The sink itself costs between $50 and $550 (CAD 65 and CAD 710) on average, depending on the model you get.

Can I Replace a Bathroom Sink Myself?
-------------------------------------

Replacing a bathroom sink isn't a small home improvement task, but it can be a DIY job if you have the right tools and skills. You'll need to be comfortable with detailed measuring and basic plumbing. If you want to replace the sink and vanity at the same time, you can get all-in-one kits cut for you to make the job easier.

If a plumbing issue is the reason you want to replace the sink, you may want to consult a professional for assistance. They may need to make more changes than just the sink to resolve the issue. They can also let you know if sink repair is a good alternative to replacement.

How Long Does It Take to Change a Bathroom Sink?
------------------------------------------------

If you're just swapping out a sink for another or dropping a vanity and sink into place, the job usually takes less than four or five hours. Bigger sink replacement jobs can take a bit longer. It all comes down to how skilled you are, whether you run into unplanned issues and what you need to modify to fit your needs. Need to cut out more space on a countertop? That's going to add some time.

How Much Does It Cost to Replace a Bathroom Countertop?
-------------------------------------------------------

Obviously, if you want to replace the vanity top as well as the sink, that will cost you more money. The type of countertop﻿ you choose can drastically change the cost.

Tile is often the cheapest, costing between [$10 and $40](https://www.costowl.com/home-improvement/countertops/countertop-tile-cost/) (CAD 13 to CAD 50) installed per square foot, depending on the material. 

Laminate is another affordable option, costing between [$20 and $60](https://www.fixr.com/costs/install-laminate-countertop#cost-of-laminate-countertops-per-square-foot) (CAD 25 to CAD 80) per square foot.

Granite costs between about [$60 and $95](https://porch.com/project-cost/cost-to-install-granite-countertops) (CAD 80 to CAD 125) per square foot.

Quartz costs between [$55 and $200](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/home-improvement/quartz-countertops-cost/) (CAD 71 to CAD 260) per square foot.

How Much Does a New Faucet Cost?
--------------------------------

If you want to add a new faucet to your bathroom sink installation project, that will increase the total price. Faucets come in a wide range of styles and finishes, so you could be looking at an expense between [$230 and $680](https://homeguide.com/costs/faucet-installation-cost#bathroom) (CAD 300 to CAD 890), including labor.

The cost of the faucet depends on the functionality, design, materials and designer. Many bathroom faucets come with common hardware for installation, but you may need to buy additional items to complete the process. This is especially true if you're switching from a one-hole to a three-hole faucet or vice versa, as you may need to cut out or hide counter holes and run some different lines.

How Much Does a Plumber Charge to Replace a Bathroom Sink?
----------------------------------------------------------

Plumbers usually charge by the hour, though some may have flat fees for specific types of work. Plumber costs can range from [$45 to $150](https://homeguide.com/costs/plumber-cost) (CAD 60 to CAD 195) per hour. You'll also have to pay for any materials, like the sink and faucet.

If a sink installation job does take several hours, you may have to pay hundreds of dollars in addition to the cost of materials. If you require sink work on a weekend or holiday, the cost may be higher.

### Should You Call a Plumber?

Dropping in a new sink is a DIY job many people are comfortable with. But if you need to rerun or adjust pipes, it might be time to call a plumber to avoid issues down the road. And if you do have a problem where water is rushing into areas where it's not supposed to be, you will definitely want to call for professional help.
