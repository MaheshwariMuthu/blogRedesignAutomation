  There’s a saying in The Sipp, “Lord willin’ and the creek don’t rise” — but if your water heater is on its last legs, Mississippians might say something more like, “Lord willin’ and the _hot water don’t run out!_” The Magnolia State may get hotter sometimes than the chili pepper in your comeback sauce, but that doesn’t make a suddenly frigid shower any less jarring. If you lose hot water in your home like a gambler loses his chips at a cold table in Tunica, you’ll be relieved to know that average water heater repair and replacement prices are substantially lower in the Magnolia State than in the rest of the country.

Your water heater powers your dishwasher, clothes washer and the hot shower you crave at the end of the day. And if your water heater’s getting long in the tooth, it's not so much a matter of _whether_ you should have it serviced, but how much that service will cost. The last thing you want right now is to be blindsided by exorbitant water heater service fees. If you’re calling around for estimates, these figures should give you a ballpark idea of how much you can expect to pay, from Tupelo, following the flow of that eponymous river and clear on over to Biloxi.

Repair and replacement costs vary depending on where you live. For comparison, the national average for diagnosis is $99, for repair is $493 and for replacement is $1,741.

The following average prices are based on aggregated HomeServe data reported by our network of contractors across the state of Mississippi:

Water Heater Diagnosis: $80
---------------------------

The diagnostic fee is what the technician will charge you to tell you what’s wrong with your system and whether it needs to be repaired or replaced. In Mississippi, this fee is about 19% lower than the national average.

Water Heater Repair: $246
-------------------------

Any of a number of things may be going wrong with your water heater — issues with the gas control valve, a faulty thermostat or a combination of several malfunctions. This average repair price includes replacement parts and the labor to install them. Repairs cost the average Mississippers _half_ of what they do the U.S. overall.

Water Heater Replace: $1,443
----------------------------

Water heaters only last about 10 years, so if it’s been a hot minute since you had yours installed, this breakdown might be a sign it’s finally given up the ghost. At the end of your water heater’s usable life, you'll need to spring for a new one. Mississippi’s average replacement price is 17% less than the nation’s.

(Note that HomeServe water heater data should generally be assumed to refer to conventional “tanked” models — the most common type — as opposed to tankless or “on-demand” models, which can cost roughly twice as much.)
