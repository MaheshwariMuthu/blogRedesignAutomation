  Dishwasher. Clothes washer. Shower. Sink faucet. These are the veritable Mount Rushmore of home appliances and systems that absolutely hafta have hot water. So, if your water heater breaks in the Mount Rushmore State, the heads of your household are gonna have to put _their_ heads together and figure out how to pay for repairs or … _gulp_, a replacement. It should come as a relief to learn that, where water heater service costs are concerned, you can generally expect your contractor to be quotin’ a South Dakotan less than your fellow American homeowner.

Your water heater is a pretty important piece of equipment. When it goes kaput, it's not so much a matter of _whether_ you should have it serviced, but how much that service will cost. And if your hot water is already out, the last thing you want right now is to be blindsided by exorbitant water heater service fees. If you’re calling around for estimates, these figures should give you a ballpark idea of how much you can expect to pay, from the Black Hills to the Coteau des Prairies.

Repair and replacement costs vary depending on where you live. For comparison, the national average for diagnosis is $99, for repair is $493 and for replacement is $1,741.

The following average prices are based on aggregated HomeServe data reported by our network of contractors across the state of South Dakota.

Water Heater Diagnosis: $93
---------------------------

The diagnostic fee is what the technician will charge you to come out to your home, inspect your system and tell you whether it needs to be repaired or replaced. In South Dakota, this fee is a few bucks lower than the national average.

Water Heater Repair: $284
-------------------------

Any of a number of things may be going wrong with your water heater — issues with the gas control valve, a faulty thermostat or a combination of several malfunctions. This average repair price includes replacement parts and the labor to install them. Repairs cost South Dakotans an average of 42% less than the U.S. overall.

Water Heater Replace: $1,577
----------------------------

Water heaters only last about 10 years, so a breakdown might be a sign that yours is on its way out. At the end of your water heater’s useful life, you'll need to spring for a new one. South Dakota’s average replacement price is about 9% lower than the nation’s.

(Note that HomeServe water heater data should generally be assumed to refer to conventional “tanked” models — the most common type — as opposed to tankless or “on-demand” models, which can cost roughly twice as much.)
