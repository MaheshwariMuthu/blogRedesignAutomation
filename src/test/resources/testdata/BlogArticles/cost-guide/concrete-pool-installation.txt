  Of the different types of inground pools homeowners can choose to put in, concrete is the most common — and it also happens to be the most expensive to install and maintain compared to vinyl and fiberglass alternatives.

Concrete Pool Installation Costs
--------------------------------

Custom concrete pools cost, on average, between $50,000 and $120,000 (CAD 68,353 and CAD 164,046), according to [HomeGuide](https://homeguide.com/costs/inground-pool-cost#concrete). That said, you can pretty much spend as much as you want, depending on size, shape, design and location.

The major benefit of concrete pools is that they can be formed into pretty much any configuration, enabling virtually limitless design options, shapes and features for customization. And although they take longer to put in, they’re also longer-lasting.

### Concrete Pool Costs Per Square Foot

The typical per-square-foot range for swimming pool construction is $80 to $250 (CAD 109 to CAD 342), with the average total price ringing in at about $62,500 (CAD 84,900), according to [HomeGuide](https://homeguide.com/costs/inground-pool-cost#concrete).

Concrete Pools: Costs by Type
-----------------------------

The three main types of concrete pools are cast (sometimes called cast-in-place), shotcrete and gunite, according to [Premier Pools & Spas](https://premierpoolsandspas.com/beginners-guide-different-types-inground-pools/), a nationwide pool-construction company. Builders start with a wood or steel frame, then cover the forms with concrete by pouring and troweling it, as in cast models, or spraying it, as with shotcrete and gunite types.

Gunite pools are by far the most expensive of these types. [Angi](https://www.angi.com/articles/gunite-pool-cost.htm) says they cost about $100,000 (CAD 136,000) on average.

Shotcrete — or wet-pumped concrete — is less expensive and highly versatile. According to pricing data from Fixr, you could pay between $32,000 and $80,000 (CAD 43,500 and CAD 108,700) for an average-sized pool.

Prefabricated models are the cheapest option, but you have little to no level of customization. And because they have to be shipped to your backyard, you’re also limited in terms of size. Prefab concrete pools generally cost between $20,000 and $50,000. (CAD 27,200 and CAD 68,000).

Concrete Pool Maintenance Costs
-------------------------------

Concrete pools also require more chemicals to remove mold and algae than other pool types. Over time, that can compromise the pool’s structural integrity, leading to damage and more costly maintenance. A concrete pool typically must be replastered every 10 to 15 years, at a cost of between $8,000 and $10,000 (CAD 10,936 and CAD 13,671).

How Long Does It Take to Build a Concrete Pool?
-----------------------------------------------

“It generally takes between 3 and 12 weeks to install a concrete pool,” according to [Popular Mechanics](https://www.popularmechanics.com/home/outdoor-projects/how-to/a8053/taking-the-plunge-how-to-pick-an-in-ground-pool-11479573/). “That's longer than other types, but concrete is considered the strongest, most durable type of pool. And unlike other inground pools, existing concrete pools can be rebuilt, refinished, enlarged or updated.”<br><iframe title="YouTube video player" width="1072" height="603" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-w93u9ICMks?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen title="Who the Heck Is HomeServe???"></iframe>
