  Whether it’s out of a refusal to be labeled or an inability to make up their minds, Arkansas inhabitants can’t seem to agree on what they should be called. Is it Arkansan? _Arkansasan_? Arkansawyer? Arkie? Be that as it may, one thing is for sure, at least, when it comes to water heater maintenance: Shivering your way through a cold shower is no one’s “natural state,” so you’ll want to be ready for the eventuality of water heater repairs or replacement. As you budget for this foregone conclusion, Arkansas residents by any name may be relieved to know that they pay less on average than their fellow Americans.

Your water heater powers your dishwasher, clothes washer and the hot shower you crave at the end of the day. When it goes kaput, it's not so much a matter of _whether_ you should have it serviced, but how much that service will cost. And if your hot water is already out, the last thing you want right now is to be blindsided by exorbitant water heater service fees. If you’re calling around for estimates, these figures should give you a ballpark idea of how much you can expect to pay from the banks of the mighty Mississippi to the Oklahoma border.

Repair and replacement costs vary depending on where you live. For comparison, the national average for diagnosis is $99, for repair is $493 and for replacement is $1,741.

The following average prices are based on aggregated HomeServe data reported by our network of contractors across the state of Arkansas:

Water Heater Diagnosis: $78
---------------------------

The technician will charge you a fee to come out to your home, tell you what’s wrong with your system and determine whether it needs to be repaired or replaced. For Arkansas homeowners at large‚ this fee is 21% less than the national average.

Water Heater Repair: $318
-------------------------

Any number of things may be going wrong with your water heater — issues with the gas control valve, a faulty thermostat or a combination of several malfunctions. This estimated repair price includes replacement parts and the labor to install them. Water heater repairs cost the average Arkansan roughly 35% less than they do nationwide.

Water Heater Replace: $1,509
----------------------------

Water heaters don’t last forever, and a breakdown might be a sign that yours is on its way out. At the end of your water heater’s usable life (about 10 years), you'll need to spring for a new one. Arkansas’ average replacement price is 13% less than that of the nation.

(Note that HomeServe water heater data should generally be assumed to refer to conventional “tanked” models — the most common type — as opposed to tankless or “on-demand” models, which can cost roughly twice as much.)
