  Generally speaking, where countertops are concerned, there are three levels of granite to choose from. The grade is determined by rarity and is based on elements like colors, veins, pitting, markings, thickness, the amount of soft materials it contains and the granite’s country of origin.

These grades range in price from dozens to hundreds of dollars per square foot, so it likely matters to your budget which one you pick.

Understanding the [different grades of granite](https://homeguide.com/costs/granite-countertops-cost) and their respective price ranges will help you better plan for your countertop project. Here’s a breakdown of the individual costs of the three major grades of granite. Some retailers will sell even higher grades — up to six or seven.

Level 2

*   Tends to be imported from India or Brazil

Level 3
-------

**$150 to $250 (CAD 204 to CAD 340) per square foot**
