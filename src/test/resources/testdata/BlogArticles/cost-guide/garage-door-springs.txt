  Most homeowners don't give their garage-door springs a second thought until something goes wrong. Your garage-door springs do a lot of heavy lifting every time you open or shut the door, so it's hardly surprising that they're one of the most common causes of garage door problems. A broken or worn-out spring often makes opening the garage door impossible, so you'll want to replace it promptly.

Replacing a garage door’s spring is relatively inexpensive, and it's usually worth paying a professional to do it for you.

Garage-Door Spring Replacement Costs
------------------------------------

According to [Bob Vila](https://www.bobvila.com/articles/garage-door-spring-replacement-cost/), replacing a garage-door spring costs between $150 and $350 (CAD 195 and CAD 450). Several factors can affect the cost of replacing these springs, including the size and number of your garage doors and the going rates for labor where you live.

You may also need to replace the cables supporting the springs, increasing the cost to between $175 and $450 (CAD 230 to CAD 590).

There are two main types of garage-door springs: extension springs and torsion springs. Which type you have significantly affects how much it costs to replace them. 

### Extension Springs

An extension spring is a long, thin spring that becomes tense when you shut the garage door so that you can open it again easily. These springs can cause injuries when they snap and are more exposed than torsion springs, so they have safety cables attached to hold them in position.

Extension springs are the cheapest type of garage-door springs to replace, costing between $15 and $45 (CAD 20 and CAD 60) for the spring itself. Expect to pay between $50 and $100 (CAD 65 and CAD 130) to replace each extension spring, including labor fees.

### Torsion Springs

Torsion springs attach to the garage door and the wall, twisting and stretching to allow it to open and shut. They operate under high pressure, so they're relatively hazardous to replace. The springs themselves cost between $30 and $100 (CAD 40 and CAD 130) per unit. It usually costs between $75 and $150 (CAD 100 and CAD 95) to replace each torsion spring, including labor.

Labor Costs
-----------

Based on data from [HomeGuide](https://homeguide.com/costs/garage-door-spring-replacement-cost#replacement), you should expect to pay between $110 and $150 (CAD 100 and CAD 95) in labor fees to replace a garage-door spring, depending on the type. Most garage-door repair companies send at least two technicians for safety reasons, and the job usually takes an hour or two.

DIY Installation Costs
----------------------

Replacing a garage-door spring yourself is significantly cheaper because you'll only need to pay for the spring itself. However, you'll need to purchase a winding bar to adjust the tension if you don't already have one and your garage door requires torsion springs. [Walmart](https://www.walmart.com/c/kp/garage-door-winding-bars?sort=price_low) sells torsion spring winding bars starting for about $25.

Replacing a garage-door spring yourself is a risky choice because of the tension involved. Generally, extension springs are safer to replace because you can significantly reduce the tension by clamping the garage door open. Replacing a torsion spring is a job best left to the professionals because the spring could snap or come loose and cause a serious injury. Installing a spring incorrectly could also cause it to break at a later date, so it's usually a better option to call a technician unless you're sure that you know what you're doing.

How Long Do Garage-Door Springs Last?
-------------------------------------

That depends on the spring type. Generally, you can expect extension springs to last between seven and 12 years. Torsion springs are more robust than extension springs and usually last longer, typically between eight and 15 years. Incorrectly installed springs tend to wear out faster, so you can extend their life span by hiring a professional to replace them.<br><iframe title="YouTube video player" width="1072" height="603" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/reJaChMAC_w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen title="Roof Replacement Costs | How Much Does it Cost to Replace a Roof?"></iframe>
