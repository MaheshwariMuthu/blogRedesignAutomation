  If you've ever lived in a house with a standalone tumble dryer that wasn't set up with a vent, you'll know just how much condensation those appliances can produce. The hassle of hooking up and remembering to empty condenser boxes can become frustrating quickly. Dryer vents free you from that chore by venting the moist air outside, keeping your home free from dampness.

Having a suitably sized, clear vent that passes through an area of your home that has a stable temperature will help keep your dryer in good working order, reducing the risk of costly breakdowns. Tumble dryers need to work harder in cold conditions, so choosing the right location can make a difference to their longevity.

How Much Does It Cost to Install a Dryer Vent Yourself?
-------------------------------------------------------

The average cost for the parts and materials required to [install a dryer vent](https://www.costimates.com/costs/heating-air-conditioning/clothes-dryer-vent/) is roughly $65 (CAD 90). This assumes that you have the tools required and don't have to do a lot of structural work to fit the duct.

The cost of fitting a vent is impacted by:

*   The type of vent
*   The material the hose is made of
*   How long the hose needs to be to travel from the dryer to the outside

It's usually easiest to install a vent in the roof, installing vent flashing and running ductwork through the attic. If your home has a crawl space, you have the option of running the tube through the floor and wall. In some cases, running a short tube directly from the dryer to the wall can be an option. Concrete walls will need to be cut with a masonry bit.

Fit a vent somewhere that is easily accessible so that you can clean it properly.

How Much Does It Cost to Have a Dryer Vent Installed?
-----------------------------------------------------

A contractor will typically charge between $125 and $460 (CAD 170 and CAD 630) to install a dryer vent. This fee covers the time and labor required as well as the removal of any waste materials. You will also need to pay for the vent and hose if these are not already in your possession.

There are several types of vents to choose from. Wire and plastic vents are the least expensive but can crack easily. Flexible metal and foil wire vents cost slightly more but are much more durable. Rigid metal vents are the most expensive and most durable, but they’re also harder to fit because they must be cut to size.

What Type of Dryer Vent Hose Is Best?
-------------------------------------

Finding the right type of hose can be challenging. Aluminum foil vent hoses are flexible and good for running short distances. Semi-rigid hoses are a good option if you need to run longer distances. They have a smoother interior than foil hoses, which means they're less likely to catch lint — and are, therefore, less of a fire risk.

If you want your hose to be concealed behind a wall, you’ll need a rigid metal one. These hoses cost more and are more complicated to fit due to the need for elbow joints when navigating corners, but they're heat resistant up to 400 degrees Fahrenheit (204 degrees Celsius) for fire safety.

Plastic or vinyl hoses are the least expensive, but many authorities prohibit them in their building codes because of the fire risk. When you replace a dryer, you may be provided with a short plastic hose, but you'll get better results over the long term if you choose a metal hose.
