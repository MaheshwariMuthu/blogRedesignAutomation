  Cookouts get a major glow-up when you have an outdoor kitchen. Installing a custom-built kitchen in your backyard lets you go from grilling burgers on the BBQ to creating and serving entire gourmet meals on your deck. And for days when you don't feel like playing sous chef in the sun, you can use your outdoor kitchen to whip up easy, convenient snacks for kids as they play in the sprinkler or the pool.

In short, there are no limits to the enjoyment you can experience when you build an outdoor kitchen. But there are limits to your budget, so it's important to consider how much an outdoor kitchen costs.

What's Typically Included in an Outdoor Kitchen?
------------------------------------------------

As with a traditional kitchen, outdoor kitchen costs range widely depending on what features and appliances you want. The size of the kitchen, the quality of the appliances and custom finishing touches all play a role in cost.

Here's a quick breakdown of what's commonly included in an outdoor kitchen and some estimated cost ranges for each:

### Grill

Depending on the size of the grill and what bells and whistles you want on it, you can expect to pay $200 to $4,000 (CAD 263 to CAD 5,263) for this part of your outdoor kitchen. (Data from [Landscaping Network](https://www.landscapingnetwork.com/outdoor-kitchens/cost.html))

### Refrigerator

A refrigerator may cost $400 to $1,000 (CAD 526 to CAD 1,315) or more, depending on how big of a cooling space you want and the options you choose.

### Structure

The overall structure of your kitchen can cost $5,000 to $12,000 (CAD 6,579 to CAD 15,790) or more, depending on the size and what materials you choose, especially for finishing touches. Stucco, manufactured stone and brick veneer tend to be less costly than natural stone.

### Sink

A stainless-steel sink may cost you around $100 (CAD 131) or more, and that doesn't include installation and plumbing. You'll also need to pay for fixtures.

### Countertops

Expect to pay $35 to $70 (CAD 46 to CAD 92) per square foot, depending on the type of countertop you choose.

How Much Does an Outdoor Kitchen Cost Total, on Average?
--------------------------------------------------------

For a basic outdoor kitchen, especially one that can be installed on the perimeter of an existing structure, total costs typically range from $2,000 to $10,000 (CAD 2,631 to CAD 13,158). Luxury outdoor kitchen costs can be $50,000 to $100,000 (CAD 65,792 to CAD 131,584) or more. The cost also tends to go up for satellite structures, which aren't attached to anything else and have to be built completely from scratch.
