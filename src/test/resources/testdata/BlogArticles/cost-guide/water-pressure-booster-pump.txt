If your plumber gives your system the green light, but you're still experiencing low water pressure, a water pressure booster pump could help you solve your bathtime woes. These clever gadgets are a relatively affordable way to increase water pressure.

What Is a Water Pressure Booster Pump?
--------------------------------------

A water pressure booster pump connects to your home's plumbing system. The water enters the pump through an inlet, and a series of rotors called impellers spin to push the water through the outlet at a higher pressure. Installing a water pressure booster pump can improve the water pressure from your faucets and showerheads.

There are several types of water pressure booster pumps, and choosing the correct model for your system is essential. The flow rate describes how much water passes through the pump per minute. You may need a booster pump with a higher flow rate if your home is larger than average. Meanwhile, the bar rating describes the water pressure exiting the pump. Like flow rates, you'll likely need a higher bar rating for a larger house.

Positive water pressure booster pumps activate when gravity draws water through your system, while negative pumps start working when the unit detects low water pressure. Which type you need depends on the pump's position in relation to your water storage tank. A plumber can advise you on the most suitable pump for your system.

How Much Does a Water Pressure Booster Pump Cost?
-------------------------------------------------

How much a water pressure booster pump costs depends on the quality of the unit. [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/home-improvement/plumbing/how-to-improve-low-water-pressure/) says you can purchase budget-friendly water pressure booster pumps for home use for as little as $600 (CAD 821). However, the cheapest units may not be as durable as more expensive options, and they may not offer as substantial an increase in water pressure.

Generally, you should expect to pay between $800 and $1,500 (CAD 1,095 and CAD 2,052) for a high-quality booster pump. The most expensive water pressure booster pumps can cost as much as $2,000 (CAD 2,737).

How Much Does Water Pressure Booster Pump Installation Cost?
------------------------------------------------------------

If you have moderate plumbing knowledge, you could consider installing your water pressure booster pump yourself. However, it's worth hiring a professional plumber if you're unsure. A knowledgeable plumber can help you determine why you have low water pressure, install your water pressure booster pump correctly and prevent issues such as leaks.

How long it takes to install a water pressure booster pump depends on a few factors, including the pump's make and model. Some units take as little as an hour to install. Expect to pay a plumber between $45 and $150 (CAD 62 and CAD 205) per hour to install a water pressure booster pump.

What Factors Affect the Cost of a Water Pressure Booster Pump?
--------------------------------------------------------------

The cost of a water pressure booster pump often depends on its power. Most domestic booster pumps deliver between 1/4 and 1 horsepower. The higher the horsepower, the more you'll likely pay. Your plumber can recommend the most suitable water pressure booster pump for your household's needs.

Various factors can impact your installation costs, including the cost of labor in your area. Plumbers typically charge more per hour in areas with high living costs. Therefore, you'll likely pay more to install a water pressure booster pump in expensive cities than in more affordable rural areas.

The condition of your plumbing system could also affect how much you pay. Your plumber may charge more to install a water pressure booster pump in an inaccessible part of your home. They may also recommend additional repairs to resolve your water pressure issues. Prices vary depending on the type of repair, but most homeowners pay between $360 and $600 (CAD 493 and CAD 821) to [fix low water pressure](https://www.forbes.com/home-improvement/plumbing/plumbing-repair-cost/).
