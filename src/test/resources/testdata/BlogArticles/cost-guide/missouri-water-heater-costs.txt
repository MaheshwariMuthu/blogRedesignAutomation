  “Age is an issue of mind over matter. If you don't mind, it doesn't matter,” goes the quotation often (if questionably) attributed to famous Missourian Mark Twain. Twain was a great author and a clever guy — but we wouldn’t recommend applying that same wisdom to your water heater if you want to prevent your shower from suddenly turning colder than the Mississippi River in January. Water heaters, on average, last around 10 years before they need to be replaced. But folks in Missouri can feel fortunate knowing that, despite what Twain _also_ purportedly said regarding [lies and statistics](https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/mark_twain_128372), HomeServe stats show that the average Show-Me State resident from The Lou to KayCeeMo pays less for water heater repairs or replacements than the average American.

Your water heater powers your dishwasher, clothes washer and the hot shower you crave at the end of the day. When it goes kaput, it's not so much a matter of _whether_ you should have it serviced, but how much that service will cost. And if your hot water is already out, the last thing you want right now is to be blindsided by exorbitant water heater service fees. If you’re calling around for estimates, these figures should give you a ballpark idea of how much you can expect to pay in Missourah.

Repair and replacement costs vary depending on where you live. For comparison, the national average for diagnosis is $99, for repair is $493 and for replacement is $1,741.

The following average prices are based on aggregated HomeServe data reported by our network of contractors across the state of Missouri:

Water Heater Diagnosis: $83
---------------------------

The technician will charge you a fee to come out to your home, tell you what’s wrong with your system and determine whether it needs to be repaired or replaced. For Missourians at large‚ this fee is about 16% lower than the national average.

Water Heater Repair: $332
-------------------------

Any number of things may be going wrong with your water heater — issues with the gas control valve, a faulty thermostat or a combination of several malfunctions. This average repair price includes replacement parts and the labor to install them. Water heater repairs in Missouri cost a full third less than they do nationwide.

Water Heater Replace: $1,428
----------------------------

Water heaters don’t last forever, and a breakdown might be a sign that yours is on its way out. At the end of your water heater’s usable life, you'll need to spring for a new one. Missouri’s average replacement price is nearly 18% less than that of the nation.

(Note that HomeServe water heater data should generally be assumed to refer to conventional “tanked” models — the most common type — as opposed to tankless or “on-demand” models, which can cost roughly twice as much.)
