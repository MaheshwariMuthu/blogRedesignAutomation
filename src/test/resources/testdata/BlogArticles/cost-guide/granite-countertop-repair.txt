  Your countertop is the heart of your kitchen. If you shelled out for a dazzling granite countertop, it's most likely the centerpiece of your space. But maybe it has been several years since it was installed. Your elegant countertops are beginning to show wear and tear in the form of chips and cracks. Can this even be fixed — or are you better off replacing them?

The good news is that, in most cases, your countertop can be rescued. Here’s how much it’ll cost to repair or resurface your granite countertop.

Is It a Crack or a Fissure?
---------------------------

Fissures occur naturally throughout stone surfaces. They are smooth to the touch, and you shouldn't be able to fit even a fingernail or credit card into them. Fissures don't cause any damage, and they don’t need to be repaired.

Cracks, on the other hand, are much more obvious. You should fix cracks as soon as possible, as they can harbor bacteria or create more structural damage over time. Cracks tend to appear in areas of high stress, like around the sink, cooktop and corners.

Why Is My Granite Countertop Cracking?
--------------------------------------

Although granite makes an ideal surface for kitchens due to its durability, it can suffer damage if not treated correctly. Your countertop may be cracking due to:

*   Heavy pots set directly on the surface
*   Impact from appliances moved around, especially near edges and corners
*   Improper installation
*   Dragging or dropping heavy items along the surface
*   Cleaning with abrasive cleaners, damaging the protective sealant layer

Can My Granite Countertop Be Repaired?
--------------------------------------

Usually, yes. You can easily make minor granite repairs yourself. A granite polishing powder is meant to handle minor scratches, chips and stains. To keep your kitchen looking fresh, you can restore your granite by resurfacing your countertops from time to time. Resurfacing and refinishing granite countertops usually refers to cleaning and resealing them.

Small cracks can be filled with an epoxy resin and a hardener. Granite repair kits are available at hardware stores. They include all the materials and tools you will need for your repair. Larger cracks can be harder to fix, and you will probably want to hire a professional to assist you.

How Much Does It Cost to Repair a Granite Countertop?
-----------------------------------------------------

According to [HomeGuide](https://homeguide.com/costs/granite-countertops-cost#square), replacing your granite countertop would cost $80 to $110 (CAD 100 to CAD 140) per square foot. Repairing your countertop rather than replacing it can save you a lot of money. The cost will vary based on:

*   The extent of the damage
*   What products you use, and how much you need
*   Whether you do it yourself or hire a repair person

Hiring a countertop repair professional costs $50 to $100 (CAD 65 to CAD 130) per hour, according to [House Digest](https://www.housedigest.com/850982/how-much-does-it-cost-to-repair-a-granite-countertop/). Filling a chip or scratch will cost between [$100 and $600](https://www.fixr.com/costs/repair-countertop#countertop-repair-cost-by-type-of-repair) (CAD 130 to CAD 770). More expensive repairs, like fixing a water-damaged countertop, could cost up to $1,000 (CAD 1,300).

For smaller, do-it-yourself jobs, you'll only pay for the materials. They’ll run you somewhere between $10 and $100 (CAD 13 and CAD 130).

Can You Reseal Granite Countertops Yourself?
--------------------------------------------

To help avoid chips and scratches in the first place, you must treat your surface with a sealer. Although durable, granite is absorbent and needs to be sealed at least once a year. You can buy a granite stone sealer and apply it yourself. Follow the directions on the package. You generally need two to three coats to get a proper cover.
