Hey, Dallas-Fort Worth homeowners, remember that time in February 2021 when North Texas looked more like the North _Pole_ after a bone-rattling blast of [arctic air from the Rocky Mountains](https://www.dmagazine.com/frontburner/2021/02/dallas-fort-worth-winter-storm-february-2021/) blew through the area, bringing snow, ice and historic subzero wind chills — ravaging the utility grid and generally menacing unacclimated Big D denizens for [nearly a week](https://www.nbcdfw.com/weather/weather-connection/after-139-hours-its-finally-above-freezing-in-dfw/2558056/)? _Not_ the ideal time for your water heater to be in need of repair or replacement. The good news is, if you think your water heater may be in need of repair or replacement and you want to get ahead of the next weather disaster, average prices in the Dallas-Fort Worth area compare favorably with those of the state of Texas in general, as well as nationwide.

Your water heater powers your dishwasher, clothes washer and the hot shower you crave at the end of the day. When it goes kaput, it's not so much a matter of _whether_ you should have it serviced, but how much that service will cost. And if your hot water is already out, the last thing you want right now is to be blindsided by exorbitant water heater service fees. If you’re calling around for estimates, it's helpful to have a ballpark idea of how much you can expect to pay in your city.

Repair and replacement costs vary depending on where you live. For comparison, the national average for diagnosis is $99, for repair is $493 and for replacement is $1,741, and for the state of Texas it’s $88 for diagnosis, $325 for repair and $1,564 for replacement. The following average prices are based on aggregated HomeServe data reported by our network of contractors across the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area:

## Water Heater Diagnosis: $67

The diagnostic fee is what the technician will charge you to tell you what’s wrong with your system and whether it needs to be repaired or replaced. In Dallas-Fort Worth, this fee is nearly one-third lower than the national average and nearly a quarter lower than Texas as a whole.

## Water Heater Repair: $350

Any of a number of things may be going wrong with your water heater — issues with the gas control valve, a faulty thermostat or a combination of several malfunctions. This average repair price includes replacement parts and the labor to install them. Repairs cost Dallas-Fort Worth dwellers roughly 9% _more_ compared with the average Texan, and 29% _less_ than Americans at large.

## Water Heater Replace: $1,494

Water heaters don’t last forever, and a breakdown might be a sign that yours is on its way out. At the end of your water heater’s usable life (about 10 years), you'll need to spring for a new one. Dallas-Fort Worth’s average replacement price is about 4% less than Texas’ and 14% less than that of the nation.

(Note that HomeServe water heater data should generally be assumed to refer to conventional “tanked” models — the most common type — as opposed to tankless or “on-demand” models, which can cost roughly twice as much.)
