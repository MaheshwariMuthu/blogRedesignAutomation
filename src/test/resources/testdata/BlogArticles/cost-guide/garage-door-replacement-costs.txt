How Long Do Garage Doors Last?
------------------------------

The average lifespan of a well-maintained garage door is 30 years, while the life of the opening mechanism averages 12 years. The material determines how long the door is going to last. For example, wood garage doors are likely to rot over time, while a metal door is going to end up with its fair share of nicks and scratches. You're going to find that choosing a new garage door requires due diligence.

Yes, you can install a garage door yourself. However, it can be a large and cumbersome task. You should probably leave the job to the pros because they’re fully equipped to take it on. Experts can get the job done quickly and correctly the first time. This is especially important if you want garage door openers installed as well.

A garage door should be replaced when it has aesthetic or functionality issues, such as when it no longer opens and closes with ease.
