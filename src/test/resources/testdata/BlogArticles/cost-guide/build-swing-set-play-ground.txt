Before you break ground on your project, check out how much it’ll cost to install a playset.

Select a Backyard Location for the Play Area
--------------------------------------------

The first thing you want to do is find a location for your new swing set or playground structure. Consider how visible your swing set or jungle gym will be from several windows in your house so you can keep an eye on the kids.

Here are several additional factors to consider when constructing and installing your backyard playground equipment:

### Grass

Do you want the swing set to be on the grass or on the edge of it? If a swing set is placed on top of the grass, it'll be tricky to mow around, but the grass will provide a soft play surface.

### Overhead Obstacles

Make sure your playground equipment and swing sets are out of the way of obstacles like power lines and tree limbs.

### Utility Components

Double-check that your play structure doesn’t interfere with utility components, gas lines or underground elements like French drains and sprinkler systems.

### Open Space

Be sure there is ample space in all directions from the intended footprint of your playground structure or swing set.

How Much Does an Outdoor Playset Cost?
--------------------------------------

There are a lot of choices when it comes to selecting and installing your outdoor playset— from simple swing sets to elaborate jungle gyms. According to [Thumbtack](https://www.thumbtack.com/p/playset-installation-cost), a playset costs between $330 and $480 (CAD 430 and CAD 630) on average, depending on materials, features and equipment. A custom set with multiple features such as rock walls, tire swings or a lookout deck can easily reach $850 (CAD 1,100) or more.

Wooden outdoor play areas are generally made of redwood, cedar or pine. You can also find playsets made of vinyl coating, plastic and metal.

Wooden playsets are sturdy and appealing but require more upkeep. Redwood is an attractive but expensive option. Cedar may be slightly less expensive but still reliable if maintained regularly. Vinyl-coated playground sets are low-maintenance but may not last as long as wood or metal. Many playsets typically include some of the following features, which can enhance the play area for your kids:

*   Bench seating
*   Lookout deck
*   Trampoline
*   Tire swing
*   Fire pole
*   Rope ladders
*   Slide
*   Awning
*   Tower
*   Clubhouse

Whatever you choose, be sure your backyard playground incorporates important safety features. For example, make sure your playground deck height is high enough that your kids don’t bump their heads on it but low enough that they can access it. Many backyard playground systems are designed to be expanded or replaced as your kids grow.

How Much Does a Swing Set Cost?
-------------------------------

The price for a swing set ranges between [$80 and $10,000](https://home.costhelper.com/swing-sets.html) (CAD 100 to CAD 13,000), excluding hardware attachments and additional assembly parts.

Plastic swing sets typically cost $100 to $1,200 (CAD 130 to CAD 1,600) and are ideal for toddlers. Plastic is generally the least expensive, but it’s also the least sturdy.

Wooden swing sets often cost about the same as plastic options, although elaborate setups with additional play equipment could cost $10,000 (CAD 13,000) or more.

Metal swing sets can cost $80 to $4,000 (CAD 100 to CAD 5,200).

How Much Does Installation Cost?
--------------------------------

Unless extensive work needs to be done to level the area, a professional may not be needed. If you want to hire a professional for the installation, make sure to factor that cost into your budget.

Most playground sets are easy to assemble and take just a few hours to set up. According to [Fixr](https://www.fixr.com/costs/build-playground#playground-installation-cost), contractors or handymen usually charge between $200 and $500 (CAD 260 and CAD 650) to install a playset. That price increases to up to $3,500 (CAD 4,600) or more for complex playsets.

Playground Area Preparation Costs
---------------------------------

If you go the DIY route, you’ll also need to factor in how much it will cost to level the play area. Make sure there are no slopes in your playground area and that enough soil is removed to accommodate your new structure. You may also consider adding a shock-absorbing surface material, such as sand, mulch or a rubber mat, which may cushion any falls.
