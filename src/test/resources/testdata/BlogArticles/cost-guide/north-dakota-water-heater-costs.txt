  When winter rolls around, North Dakotans know better than anyone: If the snow and ice doesn’t getcha, the wind chill certainly will. When the temps fall well below zero, your water heater becomes a vital piece of equipment — even if you just need to run a hot bath to warm your bones. Well, warm to this: People in the Peace Garden State pay about the same or less to service their water heaters than the average American.

Your water heater powers your dishwasher, clothes washer and the hot shower you crave at the end of the day. When it goes kaput, it's not so much a matter of _whether_ you should have it serviced, but how much that service will cost. And if your hot water is already out, the last thing you want right now is to be blindsided by exorbitant water heater service fees. If you’re calling around for estimates, these figures should give you a ballpark idea of how much you can expect to pay from the Fargo to the Badlands.

Repair and replacement costs vary depending on where you live. For comparison, the national average for diagnosis is $99, for repair is $493 and for replacement is $1,741.

The following average prices are based on aggregated HomeServe data reported by our network of contractors across the state of North Dakota:

Water Heater Diagnosis: $102
----------------------------

After you call, the technician will come out, diagnose what’s wrong with your system and determine whether it needs to be repaired or replaced. Will you have to pay for this? You betcha. In North Dakota, this diagnostic fee is just a few dollars more than the national average.

Water Heater Repair: $288
-------------------------

Any of a number of things may be going wrong with your water heater — issues with the gas control valve, a faulty thermostat or a combination of several malfunctions. This average repair price includes replacement parts and the labor to install them. Repairs cost North Dakotans an average of 42% less than the U.S. overall.

Water Heater Replace: $1,611
----------------------------

Water heaters have a limited lifespan, don’tcha know. A breakdown might be a sign that yours is on its way out. At the end of your water heater’s usable life (about 10 years), you'll need to spring for a new one. North Dakota’s average replacement price is about 7% less than the nation’s.

(Note that HomeServe water heater data should generally be assumed to refer to conventional “tanked” models — the most common type — as opposed to tankless or “on-demand” models, which can cost roughly twice as much.)
