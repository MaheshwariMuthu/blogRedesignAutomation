As Missourians are fond of saying: If you don’t like the weather, just wait 5 minutes. Unfortunately for homeowners, wild swings in temperature can wreak havoc on the underground pipeline feeding water from the municipal main, as can overzealous digging or a rogue tree root. Consequently, when you wind up with The Big Muddy running through your lawn despite your house being nowhere near the Missouri River, you’re gonna need to call in the pros to find the problem like Lewis and Clark found a path to the Pacific. Naturally, any self-respecting Show-Me State resident will want to know upfront how much they should expect to pay — and these fiscally cautious folks will feel like they’re getting a fair shake knowing that they pay a _little_ less than the national average for water-line work.

Your exterior water service line carries water from the publicly maintained water distribution system into your home. But make no mistake: Once the pipes run under your property, they’re _your_ responsibility — so you’re likely on the hook for any repair or replacement costs.

How deep your pipes are buried deeply impacts the price you pay for these services. Water service lines are buried as deep as local building codes require — but usually, the depth is determined by the frost line in your area. And the deeper the technician must dig to get to your broken or otherwise compromised line, the higher the cost.

The nationwide average water service line depth is 4.58 feet. In Missouri, these lines are buried 5.15 feet deep on average. That’s just over a half-foot difference compared with the national figure, which partially explains the state’s pretty-average price. (Consider yourselves fortunate, Missourians: Pipe depth is more than _8_ feet up in Minnesota.)

Repair and replacement costs also vary depending on where you live. The national average for diagnosis is $222, for repair is $1,039 and for replacement is $3,581.

Below, you’ll find average service prices based on aggregated HomeServe data reported by our network of contractors across Missouri, which should give you an approximation of how much you’ll pay to fix your out-of-commission water service line.

Water Service Line Diagnosis: $126
----------------------------------

Before any work can begin, the technician will need to come out and run some tests to see what’s wrong with your system. In Missouri, the fee for this is 43% lower than the national average.

Water Service Line Repair: $924
-------------------------------

A whole host of things can cause trouble with your exterior water service line — from invading tree roots to clogs to general wear and tear. Whatever’s up with your system, the repair process will likely start with excavation to expose the pipe. Depending on your situation, the technician may need to clear a blockage, find a leak or fix the pipe — and, of course, fill the hole back in.

Missouri’s average repair price is about 11% lower than the nation’s.

Water Service Line Replace: $3,427
----------------------------------

Small sections of leaky or broken pipe can be repaired, but massive clogs or fully compromised pipes might necessitate a full replacement. Water service line replacements cost Missourians about 4% less than the average American.
