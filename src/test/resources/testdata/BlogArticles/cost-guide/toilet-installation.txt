  It may not be the most glamorous fixture in your home, but there are few appliances that you depend on to remain in working order more than your toilet. A properly functioning toilet offers the baseline convenience we expect in our bathroom, but a corroded flange or damaged ring can put a serious wrench in one of the most basic parts of our daily routine.

That's why estimating toilet installation costs is so important, regardless of whether you're replacing your toilet yourself or hiring a plumber to fix an emergency leak.

Toilet Installation Costs
-------------------------

According to [HomeGuide](https://homeguide.com/costs/toilet-installation-cost), the average toilet installation costs between $120 and $230 (CAD 165 and CAD 315), excluding the toilet itself — but that can be misleading. The cost of installing a toilet can vary greatly depending on how luxurious a model you'd like, and other factors such as removal, relocation or water damage may also affect the price of your installation. Because of that, it's better to look at each variable individually to get an idea of what you can expect.

### Labor

[Thumbtack](https://www.thumbtack.com/p/plumbers-cost) estimates that the average plumber charges $85 to $129 (CAD 115 to CAD 175) an hour, though [HomeGuide](https://homeguide.com/costs/plumber-cost) notes that there’s also, typically, a callout fee of $50 to $150 (CAD 70 to CAD 205) to cover the first hour of work.

Most toilets can be installed within two to four hours by a professional plumber. At that price range and duration, the cost of labor alone for a typical toilet installation project could be as little as $120 (CAD 165), or as much as $3,875 (CAD 5,275) at the extreme end if you need to install new pipes, The majority of toilet installations fall within the $150 to $180 (CAD 205 to CAD 245) range.

### Removal

If you're replacing a toilet, you'll first need to get rid of the old one. Expect to add an extra $30 to $50 (CAD 40 to CAD 70) for your old toilet to be removed — a cost you may be able to avoid if you remove the old unit yourself.

Toilet Types
------------

The cost of installing a toilet excludes the toilet itself, so you'll want to account for this expense separately in your budget. You can purchase a budget toilet for around $100 to $200 (CAD 135 to CAD 270), while toilets with extra features, such as heated seats, could cost as much as $7,605 (CAD 10,350).

Below are the different types of toilets and their associated prices.

### Basic Toilets

Even amongst basic toilets, there are plenty of options to choose from, each of which can impact the cost significantly. Here's how the styles vary:

#### Flushing Mechanisms

There are four different flushing methods: gravity-fed, pressure-assist, dual-cycle and double-cyclone.

Gravity-fed toilets are the most common and cheapest, costing about $105 to $603 (CAD 145 to CAD 820), while pressure-assist toilets use pressurized air for a superior flush, and cost about $345 to $646 (CAD 470 to CAD 880). Dual-cycle toilets employ a combination of gravity and pressurized flushing, and range anywhere from $96 to $583 (CAD 130 to CAD 795), while double-cyclone toilets inject water from a pair of side nozzles and use centrifugal force to swirl the water for a cleaner bowl; these cost approximately $485 to $564 (CAD 660 to CAD 770).

#### Bowl Shape

Toilet bowls can be either round or elongated. Round bowls are more compact and fit better in small bathrooms, but are generally less comfortable than elongated bowls, which are more expensive.

#### One- or Two-Piece

Two-piece toilets have separate tank and fixture components, and are more common, while one-piece toilets integrate the two components into one unit. One-piece toilets can be heavier and, therefore, more difficult to install, but they’re easier to clean and offer a unique aesthetic appeal. One-piece toilets typically cost between $190 and $1,000 (CAD 260 to CAD 1,360), while two-piece units cost between $230 and $1,050 (CAD 315 and CAD 1,430) on average.

#### Efficiency

The [Environmental Protection Agency](https://www.epa.gov/watersense/residential-toilets) states that older, less-efficient toilets use up to 7 gallons of water per flush. High-efficiency toilets with the [WaterSense](https://www.epa.gov/watersense) label use as little as 1.28 gallons per flush, and can save the average household anywhere from 20% to 60% on their water bill. [Architectural Digest](https://www.architecturaldigest.com/reviews/home-improvement/new-toilet-cost) prices low-flow toilets at $100 to $1,500 (CAD 135 to CAD 2,040).

### Advanced Toilets

Although standard toilets fall in this range, there are more luxurious versions available, and their costs can vary even more. Here are just a few features you can choose to splurge on, along with their potential price tags:

#### Bidet Seats

[Bidet toilets cost](https://www.forbes.com/home-improvement/bathroom/bidet-cost/) between $1,000 and $2,000 (CAD 1,360 and CAD 2,725) without installation, according to Forbes. Alternatively, you could install a bidet seat for between $100 and $1,000 (CAD 135 and CAD 2,720). Expect to pay an extra $300 to $600 (CAD 410 to CAD 815) for installation.

#### Heated Seats

$841 to $7,605 (CAD 1,145 to CAD 10,355), according to HomeGuide.

#### Elevated Height

Basic elevated toilets start from around $150 (CAD 205), according to HomeGuide.

#### Smart Toilets

$600 to $2,000 (CAD 815 to CAD 2,725), according to Architectural Digest.

The most expensive toilet among popular models on the market today is the [Toto USA NeoRest NX2](https://www.totousa.com/neorest-nx2-dual-flush-toilet-10-gpf-08-gpf), which features a dual-cycle flush system, ultraviolet light for cleaning, elevated height, heated seats and remote-control operation for a grand total of $21,181 (CAD 28,838)— so, as you can see, toilet installation prices depend greatly on just how much luxury you're after.

Additional Toilet Installation Costs
------------------------------------

Once you begin your toilet installation, you may find that extra repairs are needed. Here are a few issues you may come across, and how much they're likely to cost you:

*   If the toilet doesn't fit in the designated space, installation will take longer, further increasing your labor costs. Measure your current toilet size before selecting a new one, just to be safe.
*   Leaks or overflows may result in water damage, which [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/home-improvement/home/water-damage-restoration-cost/) estimates can cost approximately $4 to $15 (CAD 5.45 to CAD 20) per square foot to repair.

A damaged or corroded flange may need to be replaced, costing around $200 (CAD 270), including labor, according to [HomeGuide](https://homeguide.com/costs/toilet-repair-cost).
