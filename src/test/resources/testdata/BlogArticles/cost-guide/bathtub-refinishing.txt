  Is your outdated, scratched-up tub making it impossible to relax when you just want to soak away the stress of the day? Sometimes, even deep cleaning your bathtub isn't enough to make it look like new. An old, grimy tub can bring down the look of the entire bathroom. Refinishing your bathtub is one renewal option if you're not up for a total replacement.

Looking at the cost to reglaze a tub can help you know if this project is within your bathroom renovation budget. We’ve broken down the costs below.

How Much Does It Cost to Resurface a Tub?
-----------------------------------------

The usual bathtub refinishing cost is between $335 and $630 (CAD 450 and CAD 845), based on data from [This Old House](https://www.thisoldhouse.com/bathrooms/reviews/bathtub-refinishing-cost). You can expect to pay an average of about $480 (CAD 644). This cost includes both the materials and labor if you hire a professional contractor. If your tub is in really bad shape, the job could take more work, which can increase the price by as much as $900 (CAD 1,208).

Factors That Affect the Cost to Reglaze a Tub
---------------------------------------------

The current condition of the tub is a factor in the overall cost. If it's solid with no major dings or damage, the cost should be lower. Tubs that have lots of damage cost more to refinish since the damage has to be repaired first.

The cost can also vary depending on the size and design of the tub. Larger tubs with more surface area often cost more than smaller tubs. If you're having your tub and shower refinished, plan to pay more.

DIY Tub Refinishing
-------------------

The cost to reglaze a tub yourself is cheaper than hiring a professional. [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/home-improvement/bathroom/bathtub-refinishing-cost/) says you can typically purchase a DIY kit for less than $100 (CAD 134) at a home supply store. However, the chemicals can be potentially dangerous, and the results often aren't quite as good as a professional job. It might look like you just painted the tub. The results also might not last as long as professional reglazing.

Is It Worth It to Refinish a Bathtub?
-------------------------------------

Refinishing and replacing your tub are two options to refresh the look of your bathroom. The cost to replace a tub is usually a lot higher than the cost to reglaze a tub — anywhere from $1,390 to $10,000 or more (CAD 1,865 to CAD 13,421), depending on the tub you choose and the bathroom situation. (Data from [Bob Vila](https://www.bobvila.com/articles/how-much-does-it-cost-to-replace-a-bathtub/).) If any plumbing needs to be changed or the tub doesn't fit perfectly into the place of the old tub, the installation cost is higher. If you're on a small budget and you don't mind the shape and style of your tub, reglazing is a great alternative.

Reglazing is especially worth it if you love your tub. For example, you might enjoy the style of the vintage clawfoot tub in your bathroom even though it looks a little rough. Refinishing it lets you keep the historic beauty of the tub while giving it a fresh look.

If you don't like the type of tub you’ve got, a replacement might be more suitable. Reglazing a tub makes it look like new, but it doesn't magically transform your tub into a completely different style. If you're doing a major renovation, you might decide to replace the tub instead. You might also need to replace the tub if there's major damage.

Alternative to Reglazing a Tub
------------------------------

An alternative to reglazing your tub is having a bathtub liner installed. The liner is made just for your tub using a mold to ensure it fits precisely. According to [The Spruce,](https://www.thespruce.com/bathtub-refinishing-vs-liners-1821430) a new bathtub liner typically costs $800 (CAD 1,074) or more, including installation.

Tips for Choosing a Bathtub Refinishing Company
-----------------------------------------------

Researching the bathtub refinishing companies in your area helps you find a trustworthy contractor who does the job right. Refinishing requires chemicals with a harsh odor, so you want someone who knows how to handle the chemicals properly. You also want a company that gives you professional results.

These tips will help you choose a tub refinishing company:

* **Ask for recommendations.** If anyone you know has had their tub refinished, ask them which company they used and if they would recommend them. Even better, take a look inside their tub to see the results for yourself.
* **Check for experience.** Look for a company with years of experience in the business. A company that lasts several years has likely done a good job. If you have lots of damage on your tub, make sure the company has dealt with similar damage.
* **View past work.** Ask for a portfolio of work to see the results from previous jobs. Anyone can say they offer professional results, but you want to see it for yourself.
* **Verify licensing and insurance.** The company should have any necessary business licensing required in your area. It also needs liability and workers compensation insurance. Ask for a certificate of insurance to verify that the company is covered.
* **Compare costs.** Get quotes from the companies you're considering. The company with the lowest price isn't always the best. If one company is significantly lower than the rest, it could be a warning sign of inferior work.
