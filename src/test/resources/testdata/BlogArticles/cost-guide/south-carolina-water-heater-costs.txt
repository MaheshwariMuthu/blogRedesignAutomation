  When most Americans think of South Carolina, they immediately think of either charming Charleston or mirthful Myrtle Beach — and their pleasant year-round seaside climates. But that doesn’t mean washing the sand outta your nooks and crannies is a day at the beach if a malfunctioning water heater has turned your shower cold. Here’s some good news: Water heater repairs and replacements cost the people of the Palmetto State less than the nation’s average price.

Your water heater powers your dishwasher, clothes washer and the hot shower you crave at the end of the day. When it goes kaput, it's not so much a matter of _whether_ you should have it serviced, but how much that service will cost. And if your hot water is already out, the last thing you want right now is to be blindsided by exorbitant water heater service fees. If you’re calling around for estimates, these figures should give you a ballpark idea of how much you can expect to pay, from the Savannah River to the Atlantic Ocean.

Repair and replacement costs vary depending on where you live. For comparison, the national average for diagnosis is $99, for repair is $493 and for replacement is $1,741.

The following average prices are based on aggregated HomeServe data reported by our network of contractors across South Carolina.

Water Heater Diagnosis: $84
---------------------------

First things first, the technician will come out to your home, check out your water heater and determine whether it needs to be repaired or replaced. The diagnostic fee is what the technician will charge you to tell you what’s wrong with your system. In South Carolina, this fee is about 15% lower than the national average.

Water Heater Repair: $295
-------------------------

Any of a number of things may be going wrong with your water heater — issues with the gas control valve, a faulty thermostat or a combination of several malfunctions. This average repair price includes replacement parts and the labor to install them. Repairs cost South Carolinians 40% less than the U.S. overall.

Water Heater Replace: $1,556
----------------------------

Water heaters don’t last forever, and a breakdown might be a sign that yours is on its way out. At the end of your water heater’s useful life (about 10 years), you'll need to spring for a new one. South Carolina’s average replacement price is about 11% less than the nation’s.

(Note that HomeServe water heater data should generally be assumed to refer to conventional “tanked” models — the most common type — as opposed to tankless or “on-demand” models, which can cost roughly twice as much.)
