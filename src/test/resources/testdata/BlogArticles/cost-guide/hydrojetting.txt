If you're experiencing slow drainage from your plumbing fixtures, you could have a blocked sewer line on your hands. You should never ignore a clogged sewer line — allowing the problem to worsen could cause sewage to back up inside your home.

Fortunately, hiring a plumber to hydro jet your sewer line is an effective way to get everything flowing again. Below, you'll learn how much hydro jetting costs and what factors could impact the price.

What Is Hydro Jetting?
----------------------

Hydro jetting is a method used to unclog blocked or slow-moving sewage pipes. It involves blasting highly pressurized water through sewage pipes using a specialized tool called a jetter. This tool has several nozzles designed to cut through different waste types and help shift blockages. 

You'll need to hire a professional plumber to perform hydro jetting services. The technique effectively removes scale buildup, ice, grease and even tree roots from your sewage lines and doesn't involve potentially harmful chemicals. However, it may damage older plumbing systems. Your plumber will examine your pipes using a small video camera to decide whether hydro jetting is the right solution for your sewage line issues. 

How Much Does Hydro Jetting Cost on Average?
--------------------------------------------

According to HomeGuide, [hydro jetting costs](https://homeguide.com/costs/main-sewer-line-cleaning-cost) between $250 and $800 (CAD 342 and CAD 1,095) for a home sewer line. Hydro jetting a commercial sewer line is significantly more expensive, with most business owners paying between $500 and $3,000 (CAD 684 and CAD 4,105) per treatment. 

Hiring a professional plumber to hydro jet your sewer line is costlier than unblocking the pipe with a drain snake or chemical cleaners. Plumbers typically charge between $150 and $500 (CAD 205 and CAD 684) for drain snaking and $15 to $100 (CAD 21 to CAD 137) for chemical treatments. However, hydro jetting removes clogs more effectively than other drain-unblocking techniques, and the results usually last longer. 

What Factors Impact the Cost of Hydro Jetting?
----------------------------------------------

The cost of hydro jet drain cleaning varies significantly depending on the condition of your pipes and the severity of the blockage. Consider the following factors when budgeting for hydro jetting services.

### Clog Severity

How much hydro jetting costs depends on the severity of the clog. You could pay toward the lower end of the price range for a mildly blocked sewer line. Meanwhile, hydro jetting a severe blockage in a residential property could cost as much as $1,000 (CAD 1,368).

### Repairs

You may need to repair your sewer line if it develops a leak or becomes damaged due to hydro jetting. Sewer line repair costs depend on the type and extent of the damage, but most homeowners spend between $150 and $3,800 (CAD 205 and CAD 5,199) per repair. Expect to pay between $50 and $250 (CAD 68 and CAD 342) per linear foot to replace damaged pipes. 

### Labor Costs

Several factors can increase the time it takes to hydro jet a sewer line. The job may take longer if your pipes are inaccessible or severely blocked. Plumbers typically charge $45 to $150 (CAD 62 to CAD 205) per hour for hydro jetting and related services. You may pay more if you live in a city with high living costs. 

### Sewer Cleanout Installation

Your plumber may recommend installing a sewer cleanout to improve access to your sewer pipes. Sewer cleanout installation makes hydro jetting easier and usually costs between $600 and $2,000 (CAD 821 and CAD 2,737).

### Tree Root Removal

While hydro jetting can sometimes remove tree roots from your sewer lines, you may need to pretreat significant growth. Most plumbers charge between $200 and $600 (CAD 274 and CAD 821) for tree root removal services.<br><iframe title="YouTube video player" width="1072" height="603" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nk_hBpyP3Fk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen title="How Much Does Sewer Line Maintenance and Repair Cost?"></iframe>
