Samsung smart refrigerators come in a wide variety of configurations, including top freezer, 4-door and even bespoke designs. Each model connects to the SmartThings app via integrated Wi-Fi, letting you adjust the settings and check the temperature from any compatible device. The smudge-resistant finishes make it easier to keep your fridge clean without leaving fingerprints behind whenever you grab something to eat or drink. 

All Samsung smart refrigerators contain multiple vents to ensure consistent cooling throughout the entire interior. Some models also feature Samsung's FlexZone technology that allows you to switch the internal storage spaces between fridge and freezer mode for added flexibility. Fridges with FlexZone have various preset temperatures for different products so that you can choose the ideal setting for each section. 

Certain models also come with a Family Hub built into one of the door fronts. A Family Hub functions somewhat like a large tablet and lets you connect to virtual assistant devices to control the fridge with your voice. You can also use it to perform a wide range of other tasks, such as writing shopping lists and sending messages from a convenient central location in your kitchen. These models also have internal cameras that let you see what's inside your fridge from anywhere. 

Not all Samsung smart refrigerators come with a full range of smart features. It's important to check the product specifications to ensure that the model you're considering includes the features you're looking for.

How Long Do Smart Fridges Last?
-------------------------------

Smart fridges should last roughly as long as a regular refrigerator — 10 years or more, according to [Wirecutter](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/blog/how-long-connected-devices-secure/). However, while the fridge will continue to keep food adequately cool for this long, that doesn't mean that the smart features will last for the same amount of time.

Some critics of smart appliances are concerned that manufacturers could stop releasing software and security updates for smart appliances long before they reach the end of their expected lifespan. Fortunately, Samsung has released a statement committing to providing security updates for smart appliances for at least the warranty length, which is 10 years for a Samsung smart refrigerator.
