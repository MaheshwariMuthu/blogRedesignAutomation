Average Kitchen Cabinet Costs
-----------------------------

It depends. There are a few things you have to figure out first, like how much material you’ll need and what kind of materials you want to use. Another question to answer is whether you're going to do the installation yourself or hire a professional to do it.

However, there are estimates on the cost of new kitchen cabinets you can use to get an idea of how much money you need to complete the project.

According to [Bob Vila](https://www.bobvila.com/articles/cost-of-kitchen-cabinets/), the typical price range of new kitchen cabinets is about $1,800 to $9,200 (CAD 2,300 to CAD 11,800) — or $100 to $1,200 (CAD 130 to CAD 1,540) per linear foot — with the national average being about $5,400 (CAD 6,900).

One thing to consider, if you have the room, is to install an island in the middle of the kitchen to create extra working and storage space. This may add to the cost of your project, but it can make a huge functionality difference down the road in your cooking space.

Kitchen Cabinet Costs by Type
-----------------------------

The types of kitchen cabinets you want to install greatly affect the price, and you obviously want to choose something that won't break the budget. Here's a brief overview of the different types of cabinets you can choose for your kitchen.

### Stock

Stock kitchen cabinets are what you see when you go to a store and there are cabinets already made and ready for installation on the showroom floor. These are ready to go as is, but you have to be careful of measurements. Ensure you have full measurements for your space before you buy. If you're not careful, you could end up with cabinets that are too small or too big, and before you know it, you're headed back to the store to buy something that actually fits the space.

Stock cabinets are the most budget-friendly option at $100 to $300 (CAD 130 to CAD 385) per linear foot.

### Semi-Custom

These cabinets can also be found on the showroom floor. The difference between stock and semi-custom is that you can customize certain aspects of the latter. The cabinet sizes are the same as stock, but you can change the size of drawers, doors and depth to personalize the unit.

The costs for semi-custom cabinets fall between $150 and $650 (CAD 190 and CAD 830) per linear foot on average.

### Custom

If you're really looking to do something special, you want to go the custom route. This is the most expensive, running anywhere from $500 to $1,200 (CAD 640 to CAD 1,540) per linear foot. The cabinets are built to order. Unless you have excellent carpentry skills, this is a job for professionals.

Kitchen Cabinet Costs by Material
---------------------------------

The cost of materials dramatically affects the average cost to replace kitchen cabinets. Most cabinet frames are made out of plywood and solid wood (plywood doesn't warp as easily as regular wood). The cost for the finishing is where there are tremendous differences in prices:

* **Wood Veneer:** $2,000 to $15,000 (CAD 2,600 to CAD 19,300)
* **Laminate:** $4,000 to $15,000 (CAD 5,100 to CAD 19,300)
* **Wood:** $5,000 to $25,000 (CAD 6,400 to CAD 32,100)
* **Acrylic:** $5,000 to $20,000 (CAD 6,400 to CAD 32,100)
* **Stainless Steel:** $25,000 to $38,000 (CAD 32,1000 to CAD 48,800)

Installation Costs
------------------

The cost is usually based on the installation of a single cabinet and can run anywhere from $80 to $190 per unit (CAD 100 to CAD 245).

Cost to Reface Existing Cabinetry
---------------------------------

Instead of installing new cabinets, you may want to refinish the old ones. This is not always recommended, and you should consult a professional to see if it’s even possible for your space. Not all surfaces can be refinished.

Costs for refinishing cabinets typically run between $4,200 and $8,100 (CAD 5,400 and CAD 10,400) for a full kitchen.

Can You Install Kitchen Cabinets Yourself?
------------------------------------------

You can decide to do the installation yourself. This is possible if you have the right tools and experience. Otherwise, you're better off letting someone who knows what they're doing do the work.<br><iframe title="YouTube video player" width="1072" height="603" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2aLs7X_hMxU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
