  If your boiler isn't producing enough heat, costs a fortune to run or is simply past its prime, it may be time to think about boiler replacement. Many homeowners put off replacing their boiler because they're worried about having to pay high replacement costs. However, installing a newer, more efficient boiler could save you money on your energy bills.

Below, you can find out how much boiler replacement costs according to boiler type, including installation fees.

How Much Does a New Boiler Cost?
--------------------------------

According to [HomeGuide](https://homeguide.com/costs/boiler-replacement-cost), the average price for a standard residential boiler is between $1,400 and $6,500 (CAD 1,900 and CAD 8,820), excluding installation. Standard boilers, also known as conventional boilers, are the most commonly used boiler type in new-build properties.

However, you may end up paying significantly more or less depending on the boiler type and size. Boiler size is measured in British Thermal Units, which refers to the unit's hourly heat output. Generally, the higher the BTU rating, the more you should expect to pay. Larger boilers generally take more time and effort to install, so a larger replacement boiler may cost more in labor fees. The size of boiler you need depends on your home's square footage and your local climate.

How Much Does It Cost to Have a New Boiler Installed?
-----------------------------------------------------

On average, you should expect to pay around $6,100 (CAD 8,278) to buy and install a new boiler, with a typical range between $3,200 and $9,000 (CAD 4,342 and CAD 12,213).

Contractors generally charge around $45 to $150 (CAD 61 to CAD 204) per hour for labor. You could be charged an extra fee between $200 and $500 (CAD 271 and CAD 678) to dispose of your existing boiler, but many companies offer free removal services when you hire them for boiler replacement.

Typically, [HomeGuide](https://homeguide.com/costs/gas-boiler-prices) says it costs between $1,000 and $3,500 (CAD 1,357 and CAD 4,749) in labor fees to install a gas or propane boiler. Labor for an electric boiler will likely cost between $700 and $2,000 (CAD 950 and CAD 2,714), according to data from [Fixr](https://www.fixr.com/costs/electric-fired-boiler-system). Expect to pay between $1,500 and $3,500 (CAD 2,035 and CAD 4,749) for the labor to [install an oil-fueled model](https://www.fixr.com/costs/oil-boiler).

You may also need to pay extra to install components like ductwork or a gas line if your replacement boiler is a different type than your existing unit.

Is There a Price Difference Between Different Types of Boilers?
---------------------------------------------------------------

One of the main factors affecting boiler replacement costs is the type of boiler you choose.

Electric boilers are generally the cheapest to buy and install, costing between $1,000 and $6,000 (CAD 1,357 and CAD 8,142) for the unit alone and $1,800 to $8,000 (CAD 2,443 to CAD 10,856) installed. However, electric boilers are relatively costly to run and aren't usually suitable for large homes with high heating requirements.

Gas and propane boilers typically cost between $1,400 and $5,600 (CAD 1,900 and CAD 7,599) per unit and $2,800 to $9,000 (CAD 3,800 to CAD 12,213) with professional installation. Gas boilers are generally cheaper to run and are highly energy-efficient, but propane boilers are more environmentally friendly. Either option will usually cost you less to run than an electric, oil or wood boiler.

Oil boilers typically cost $1,700 to $6,500 (CAD 2,307 to CAD 8,820) for the unit itself and $3,300 to $9,000 (CAD 4,071 to CAD 12,213) installed. They’re a popular option in areas without widespread gas availability. However, they're relatively expensive to maintain and run, and they tend to be less energy-efficient than gas-powered boilers.

Wood boilers are the most expensive type of replacement boiler to install, costing $7,000 to $16,000 (CAD 9,499 to CAD 21,712) installed. However, they're significantly cheaper to run than conventional boilers if you have a ready supply of firewood, and they’re usually big enough to heat large homes.

How Long Do Boilers Last?
-------------------------

Standard residential gas boilers generally last [between 10 and 15 years](https://www.doityourself.com/stry/the-average-boiler-life-expectancy) if you maintain them correctly. Electric boilers generally have slightly shorter life spans, lasting between 8 and 10 years on average. Premium boilers could last as long as 20 years before you need a boiler replacement.

Corrosion is one of the most common reasons for a premature boiler breakdown. You can avoid damage to your boiler system by booking an annual boiler service with a licensed technician and following their maintenance instructions between services.
