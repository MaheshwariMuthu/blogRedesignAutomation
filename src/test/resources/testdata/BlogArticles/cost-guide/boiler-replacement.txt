However, installing a newer, more efficient boiler could save you money on your energy bills.

Below, you can find out how much boiler replacement costs according to boiler type, including installation fees.

How Much Does a New Boiler Cost?
--------------------------------

According to Bob Vila, the average price for a standard residential boiler is [around $3,500](https://www.bobvila.com/articles/residential-boiler-prices/) (CAD 4,440). The typical range is between $2,700 and $7,700 (CAD 3,425 to CAD 9,770), excluding installation. Standard boilers, also known as conventional boilers, are the most commonly used boiler type in new-build properties.

However, you may end up paying significantly more or less depending on the boiler type and size. Boiler size is measured in British Thermal Units, which refers to the unit's hourly heat output. Generally, the higher the BTU rating, the more you should expect to pay. Larger boilers generally take more time and effort to install, so a larger replacement boiler may cost more in labor fees. What size boiler you need depends on your home's square footage and your local climate.

How Much Does It Cost to Have a New Boiler Installed?
-----------------------------------------------------

According to data from [Fixr](https://www.fixr.com/costs/new-boiler-installation), you should expect to pay around $8,360 (CAD 10,600) to buy and install a gas boiler, with a typical range between $1,500 and $15,000 (CAD 1,900 and CAD 19,000).

Contractors generally charge around $100 (CAD 130) per hour for labor. You could be charged an extra fee between $50 and $200 (CAD 60 and CAD 250) to dispose of your existing boiler, but many companies offer free removal services when you hire them for boiler replacement.

Typically, it costs between $2,600 and $4,000 (CAD 3,250 and CAD 5,000) in labor fees to install a gas or propane boiler. Labor costs for an electric boiler will likely cost between $700 and $2,000 (CAD 875 and CAD 2,500). Expect to pay between $2,300 and $2,500 (CAD 2,875 and CAD 3,125) for the labor to install an oil-fueled model.

You may also need to pay extra to install components like ductwork or a gas line if your replacement boiler is a different type to your existing unit.

Is There a Price Difference Between Different Types of Boilers?
---------------------------------------------------------------

One of the main factors affecting boiler replacement costs is the type of boiler you choose.

Electric boilers are generally the cheapest to buy and install, costing between $1,500 and $9,000 (CAD 1,900 and CAD 11,250), including labor. However, electric boilers are relatively costly to run and aren't usually suitable for large homes with high heating requirements.

Gas or propane boilers typically cost between $3,800 and $12,000 (CAD 4,750 and CAD 15,000) installed. Gas boilers are generally cheaper to run and are highly energy-efficient, but propane boilers are more environmentally friendly. Either option will usually cost you less to run than an electric, oil or wood boiler.

Oil boilers typically cost $4,000 to $9,000 (CAD 5,000 to CAD 11,250), including labor. They’re a popular option in areas without widespread gas availability. However, they're relatively expensive to maintain and run, and they tend to be less energy-efficient than gas-powered boilers.

Wood boilers are the most expensive type of replacement boiler to install, costing $8,000 to $20,000 (CAD 10,000 to CAD 25,000). However, they are significantly cheaper to run than conventional boilers if you have a ready supply of firewood, and they’re usually large enough to heat large homes.

How Long Do Boilers Last?
-------------------------

Standard residential gas boilers generally last [between 10 and 15 years](https://www.doityourself.com/stry/the-average-boiler-life-expectancy) if you maintain them correctly. Electric boilers generally have slightly shorter lifespans, lasting between 8 and 10 years on average. Premium boilers could last as long as 20 years before you need a boiler replacement.

Corrosion is one of the most common reasons for a premature boiler breakdown. You can avoid damage to your boiler system by booking an annual boiler service with a licensed technician and following their maintenance instructions between services.<br><iframe title="YouTube video player" width="1072" height="603" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pM2NlhbKBH0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
