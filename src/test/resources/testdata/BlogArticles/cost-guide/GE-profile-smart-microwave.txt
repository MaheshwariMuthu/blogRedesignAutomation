There’s nothing more irritating than repeatedly taking your food out of the microwave just to realize it’s not quite ready yet. You now have the option of letting modern technology do the work for you.

The [GE smart microwave](https://www.geappliances.com/appliance/GE-0-9-Cu-Ft-Capacity-Smart-Countertop-Microwave-Oven-with-Scan-To-Cook-Technology-JES1097SMSS) is one option that can help make your meal preparation more hassle-free. Here’s how much you’ll pay for one.

How Much Do GE Smart Microwaves Cost?
-------------------------------------

GE smart microwaves cost about $154 (CAD 193) as of 2021. However, this price is relatively reasonable, given that the costs of competing smart microwaves, including those made by [Samsung](https://www.homeserve.com/en-us/blog/cost-guide/samsung-smart-microwave/), start at around $349 (CAD 440). As discussed below, you may be paying a bit more for the smart features than if you bought a regular microwave, but the extra cost may be worth it to you, depending on your cooking needs.

How Do the Features of a GE Smart Microwave Compare to a Regular Microwave?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Unlike a regular microwave, the GE smart microwave offers Scan-to-Cook technology.

After downloading the GE Appliances Kitchen app on your phone, you remotely connect the microwave to the app and scan the barcode on your microwave-ready food package. As long as the package brand is included in GE’s list of [compatible brands](https://products.geappliances.com/appliance/gea-support-search-content?contentId=37351), the app sets the microwave to the correct cooking time for that package. All you have to do is put the package in the microwave and hit start. From the app, you can also see the status of the microwave, add time to the cooking and receive notifications when the timer is done.

Another feature you won’t find with a regular microwave is the voice command feature, which is compatible with any Alexa-enabled device. Using the voice command through the SmartHQ app, you can start, stop, pause, add cooking time and more.

The GE smart microwave also outputs 900 watts of power, but many microwaves offer more power than that, including [GE’s regular countertop microwave](https://www.geappliances.com/appliance/GE-1-1-Cu-Ft-Capacity-Countertop-Microwave-Oven-JESP113SPSS) that outputs 950 watts and [Samsung’s regular countertop microwave](https://www.samsung.com/us/home-appliances/microwaves/countertop/mg11h2020-1-1-cu-ft-counter-top-microwave-with-grilling-element-stainless-steel-mg11h2020ct-aa/?cid=pla-ecomm-pfs-ha-us-google-na-01172020-169918-&ds_e=GOOGLE-cr:0-pl:265994333-&ds_c=FF~%5BHA%5D_CN~home+appliances_PH~on_MK~us_BS~ec_PR~dcr_SB~damul_PK~roas_FS~loe_CA~pla_MD~h_KS~ba_MT~na-&ds_ag=AG_%5BHA%5D+Microwaves_MK~us_AT~sa_MD~h_PB~goss_AI~no-&ds_k=PRODUCT_GROUP&gclid=Cj0KCQiA8ICOBhDmARIsAEGI6o1R47z7AHGdwJdwSPtFKbTiXX91BS_dq0hryLIylxfQu8bKSOQKOLEaAi-xEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds) that outputs 1,000 watts.

Most microwaves have somewhere between 600 and 1,200 watts, so the GE Smart Microwave sits right in the middle. Depending on your cooking needs, the smart features may be worth the 900-wattage level, or you may want to spring for a higher wattage microwave and forgo the smart features.

The GE smart microwave currently only comes in the form of a countertop microwave, as opposed to an over-the-range microwave, which is typically built-in over the stove and blends into the kitchen. However, you can easily bring a countertop microwave with you if you ever move instead of having to buy a new one.

What’s the Price Difference?
----------------------------

When choosing to purchase the $154 (CAD 193) GE smart microwave, you will be paying a bit more for the smart features. Similar microwaves that are missing the smart features but have the same 0.9-cubic-foot capacity and 900 watts of power cost about 20% to 30% less than the GE smart microwave.

For example, [Whirlpool](https://www.lowes.com/pd/Whirlpool-Countertop-Microwave-with-900-Watts-Cooking-Power-Stainless-Steel/5005471183) and [GE’](https://www.homedepot.com/p/GE-0-9-cu-ft-Countertop-Microwave-in-Stainless-Steel-JES1095SMSS/305969257?source=shoppingads&locale=en-US&&mtc=Shopping-VF-F_D29A-G-D29A-029_015_COOKING-Multi-NA-Feed-SMART-NA-NA-MajorAppl_Microwaves_Test&cm_mmc=Shopping-VF-F_D29A-G-D29A-029_015_COOKING-Multi-NA-Feed-SMART-NA-NA-MajorAppl_Microwaves_Test-71700000088880746-58700007518041490-92700067688245492&gclid=Cj0KCQiA8ICOBhDmARIsAEGI6o3FQGnsTxz8XqIg0cGV7pltayzbcM--AE0cJKbouMGXHkeVXJHuV-oaAlheEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds)s similar stainless steel countertop microwaves cost about $100 and $120 (CAD 125 to CAD 150), respectively. [Sharp](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/sharp-carousel-1-1-cu-ft-mid-size-microwave-stainless-steel/5712110.p?skuId=5712110)’s stainless steel countertop microwave, which has an increased 1.1-cubic-foot capacity and outputs 1,000 watts of power, costs about $109 (CAD 136).<br><iframe title="YouTube video player" width="1072" height="603" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ByKX1s5TgBY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
