How Much Does Installation Cost?
--------------------------------

Installation costs vary depending on the cost of living in your area. According to data from [HomeGuide](https://homeguide.com/costs/marble-countertops-cost#install), you can expect to pay between $35 and $45 (CAD 44 and CAD 56) an hour for labor, or $10 (CAD 12.50) per square foot.
