Knowing how much drywall installation costs can help you create a realistic project budget. Here’s a breakdown of drywall costs, including panel costs by type and average labor fees for installation.

What Is Drywall?
----------------

Drywall is a type of paneling material made from a layer of gypsum sandwiched between two thick paper layers. Builders use drywall to construct walls, ceilings and other architectural features.

You can install drywall panels by screwing them to wooden wall studs and applying a layer of plaster. It's significantly quicker and cheaper to install drywall than traditional building materials like brick and plaster. You can also use smaller drywall patches to conceal holes in existing walls.

Average Cost of Drywall
-----------------------

According to [Bob Vila](https://www.bobvila.com/articles/drywall-cost/), the average cost of a standard 4-foot by 8-foot (1.2-meter by 2.5 meter) drywall panel is $15 (CAD 19), with a typical range between $12 and $90 (CAD 15 and CAD 115). How much you pay depends on the drywall type, finish and the project's complexity. It's often cheaper per square foot to install drywall in a larger room because it allows you to use full sheets.

Different Types of Drywall
--------------------------

There are various types of drywall available, and the type that’s best depends on your project type and the environmental conditions. Standard drywall is available in multiple thicknesses and costs between $8 and $20 (CAD 10 and CAD 25) per sheet on average, based on data from [HomeGuide](https://homeguide.com/costs/sheetrock-drywall-prices). You can use standard drywall to build and repair walls and ceilings.

Other common drywall types include:

### Green Board

This is a water-resistant drywall for moist environments. It costs between $12 and $20 (CAD 15 and CAD 25).

### Purple Board

This is also a type of water-resistant drywall for use in moist environments. Expect to pay $12 to $22 (CAD 15 to CAD 28).

### Plasterboard

Plasterboard is drywall manufactured with a plaster veneer. It costs $12 to $16 (CAD 15 to CAD 20).

### Paperless

Paperless drywall is a type of mold- and rot-resistant plasterboard. It has a fiberglass coating and costs between $13 and $26 (CAD 16 and CAD 33).

### Fire-Resistant Type X

Type X drywall (also called fire-rated drywall) takes longer to burn in a fire. It costs $10 to $20 (CAD 13 to CAD 25).

### Soundproof

Soundproof drywall is just what it says on the tin. Because of its special properties, it costs more — $30 to $100 (CAD 38 to CAD 127) on average.

Drywall Installation Costs
--------------------------

There are two main costs involved in drywall installation: hanging and finishing. According to [Bob Vila](https://www.bobvila.com/articles/drywall-cost/), you should expect to pay between $1 and $1.50 (CAD 1.25 and CAD 1.90) per square foot for a professional contractor to hang the drywall.

Drywall finishing typically costs between $1.25 and $3 (CAD 1.60 and CAD 3.80) per square foot. Overall, professional drywall installation costs between $30 and $60 (CAD 38 and CAD 76) per panel.

Additional Installation Considerations
--------------------------------------

Several other factors could impact the overall cost of your project. You'll need to factor in the price of installing or upgrading your wall insulation. There are various wall insulation types available, costing between $35 and $52 (CAD 44 and CAD 66) per square foot on average, according to [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/home-improvement/cost-to-install-wall-insulation/).

If you're replacing an existing wall, you'll also need to consider the costs of drywall removal. Fortunately, drywall is the cheapest wall material type to remove. [Fixr](https://www.fixr.com/costs/remove-wall#cost-to-knock-down-a-wall-by-material) says removal costs between 30 and 45 cents (CAD 0.40 to CAD 0.60) per square foot.

Finally, don't forget to factor in the costs of building permits if you're creating a new structure. How much a building permit costs varies significantly depending on the project type and where you live. You can find out how much a permit will cost for your project by contacting your local building inspections and permit office.
