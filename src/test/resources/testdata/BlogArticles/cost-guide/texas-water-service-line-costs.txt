Y’all know what they say down there in the Lone Star State: [“Don’t mess with Texas!”](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjixfuXuM_yAhUOAp0JHeMpAg4QFnoECDUQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dontmesswithtexas.org%2Fabout%2Fhistory%2F&usg=AOvVaw0pZnHOWY2WJhEZeWiCWMjX) Too bad you can’t tell your water service line the same thing. Even buried deep underground, it sure can cause a ruckus if something goes wrong. And if you start noticing puddles in the yard, you’re gonna need to have it seen to right quick, ’less you want a real mess on your hands. The good news is that, by and large, the average Texan pays less to repair or replace their water service line than the average American.

Your exterior water service line carries water from the public water main into your home. But make no mistake: Once the pipes run under your property, they’re your responsibility — so you’re likely on the hook for any repair or replacement costs.

The price you pay for these services has to do with how deep your pipes are buried. Water service lines are buried as deep as local building codes require — but usually, the depth is determined by the frost line in your area. And the deeper the technician has to dig to get to your broken line, the higher the cost.

The nationwide average water service line depth is 4.58 feet but, in Texas, these lines are buried just 2.93 feet deep on average — and shallow pipes can cause problems, too. During what we’re calling the [Great Dallas Deep Freeze of 2021](https://dallas.culturemap.com/news/city-life/02-18-21-plumber-burst-pipes-water-meter-key/), for example, many Texas homeowners saw their shallowly buried pipes burst due to the abnormally cold weather.

Repair and replacement costs also vary depending on where you live. The national average for diagnosis is $222, for repair is $1,039 and for replacement is $3,581.

Below, you’ll find average service prices based on aggregated HomeServe data reported by our network of contractors across Texas, which should give you an approximation of how much you’ll pay to fix your out-of-commission water service line.

Water Service Line Diagnosis: $211
----------------------------------

Before any work can begin, the technician will need to come out and run some tests to see what’s wrong with your system. In Texas, the fee for this is about 5% lower than the national average.

Water Service Line Repair: $859
-------------------------------

A whole host of things can cause trouble with your exterior water service line — from invading tree roots to clogs to general wear and tear. Whatever’s up with your system, the repair process will likely start with excavation to expose the pipe. Depending on your situation, the technician may need to clear a blockage, find a leak or fix the pipe — and, of course, fill the hole back in.

Texas’ average repair price is about 17% lower than the nation’s.

Water Service Line Replace: $2,382
----------------------------------

Small sections of leaky or broken pipe can be repaired, but massive clogs or fully compromised pipes might necessitate a full replacement. Water service line replacements cost Texans about 33% less than the average American.
