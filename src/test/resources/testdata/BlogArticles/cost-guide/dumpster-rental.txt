The main thing is how much it costs. A few factors affect how much you'll pay. Find out how to estimate the costs below.

How Much Does It Cost to Rent a Dumpster?
-----------------------------------------

The average cost to rent a dumpster is about $380 (CAD 510), according to [Bob Vila](https://www.bobvila.com/articles/dumpster-rental-prices/), with a typical range between about $300 and $480 (CAD 400 and CAD 640). How much it costs to rent a dumpster varies depending on where you live because dumpster companies in some areas have to pay higher disposal fees. Tax rates and labor costs also differ from place to place.

The price you pay also depends on the size of the dumpster and the total weight of the debris you're disposing of. Dumpster companies pay landfill fees per ton. So, the larger the dumpster, the more it can hold and the more it will cost you to rent. If you exceed the weight limit stipulated by your rental company, you will most likely have to pay an extra charge. Also, bear in mind that some types of debris are more expensive to dispose of than others.

Finally, you should consider how long you’ll need the dumpster. A longer rental period will cost you more, but it's important to make sure you allow enough time to complete your project to avoid additional fees if you run over.

How Does Dumpster Pricing Work?
-------------------------------

Most companies calculate the cost to rent a dumpster as a single fee, taking into account transportation, taxes and waste disposal. The costs increase in proportion to dumpster size. The advantage of this type of pricing structure is that you know exactly how much the dumpster costs without getting blindsided by unexpected fees later on.

However, you may find some dumpster companies charge you according to the debris weight or volume. Calculating costs in this way could work in your favor if you don't end up filling the entire dumpster, as you'll only pay for the debris you actually dispose of.

Keep in mind that you may be charged additional fees if you exceed the stated debris weight capacity or your project overruns and you keep the dumpster for longer than the contracted time. You may also need to pay for a permit if you intend to place the dumpster on public land.

How Much Does a 10-Yard Dumpster Hold?
--------------------------------------

You can fit around [10 cubic yards](https://www.alliancedsp.com/dumpster-sizes/ten-yard-dumpster/) of debris in a 10-yard dumpster, equating to a total weight of roughly 2 to 3 tons. However, some companies stipulate a set weight limit — often 2 tons. A 10-yard dumpster is only suitable for disposing of debris from reasonably small projects, such as a garage clear-out. If you're remodeling a kitchen or bathroom, a 10-yard dumpster probably won't be big enough.

How Do Dumpster Rentals Work?
-----------------------------

The first step toward renting a dumpster is deciding what size you need and contacting a local rental company. If you're not sure which size to choose, the company should be able to advise you if you provide details of your project. Ask them how they calculate rental costs. Some customers prefer to pay a flat rate, and others prefer to pay for the exact amount of debris that needs to be disposed of.

Once you've arranged your dumpster rental, the company will deliver the dumpster to your address. Don't forget to apply for a permit if you intend to place the dumpster on a public right of way. You can then fill the dumpster with debris, taking care not to exceed the fill line or agreed-upon weight limit.

The rental company will then collect the dumpster at the end of the rental and take it to a landfill site to dispose of the debris. It's important to make sure you are ready to return the dumpster by the set date, or you risk being charged an extra fee.
