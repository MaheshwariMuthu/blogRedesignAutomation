  It can get hot out there on the plains, Nebraskans. You probably remember (or, at least, you can imagine) being a teenager, traipsing out into the fields and detasseling corn for some extra pocket money ... OK, perhaps that’s not a _universal_ Nebraskan experience, but this one should hit home: After a sweltering summer’s day out at the tailgate, you come home to a shower that only spits out cold water. No need to panic, cornhuskers; compared to the national average, it costs less to service your water heater in Nebraska.

Your water heater powers your dishwasher, clothes washer and the hot shower you crave at the end of the day. When it goes kaput, it's not so much a matter of _whether_ you should have it serviced, but how much that service will cost. And if your hot water is already out, the last thing you want right now is to be blindsided by exorbitant water heater service fees. If you’re calling around for estimates, these figures should give you a ballpark idea of how much you can expect to pay — no matter if you’re out there in the panhandle or clear ’cross the state in Omaha.

Repair and replacement costs vary depending on where you live. For comparison, the national average for diagnosis is $99, for repair is $493 and for replacement is $1,741.

The following average prices are based on aggregated HomeServe data reported by our network of contractors across Nebraska.

Water Heater Diagnosis: $92
---------------------------

The diagnostic fee is what the technician will charge you to come out to your home, inspect your system and tell you whether it needs to be repaired or replaced. In the Cornhusker State, this fee is about 7% lower than the national average.

Water Heater Repair: $274
-------------------------

Any of a number of things may be going wrong with your water heater — issues with the gas control valve, a faulty thermostat or a combination of several malfunctions. This average repair price includes replacement parts and the labor to install them. Repairs cost Nebraskans an average of 44% less than the U.S. overall.

Water Heater Replace: $1,439
----------------------------

If you’ve gotten 10 years out of your water heater, consider yourself lucky. That’s about the average lifespan of these machines. If yours is getting up there in years, this breakdown might be a sign that it has reached the end of its useful life, in which case, you’ll need to spring for a new one. Nebraska’s average replacement price is about 17% less than the nation’s.

(Note that HomeServe water heater data should generally be assumed to refer to conventional “tanked” models — the most common type — as opposed to tankless or “on-demand” models, which can cost roughly twice as much.)
