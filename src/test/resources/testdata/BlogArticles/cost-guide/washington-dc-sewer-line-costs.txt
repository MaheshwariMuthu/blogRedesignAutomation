In Washington, D.C., in recent years, there’s been a whole lot of talk about (if you’ll pardon the expression), “draining the swamp.” We’ll leave the sloganeering to the professional politicians who populate the seat of American democracy, but when it comes to unpleasantly odorous, bog-like conditions welling up in your yard that suggest a compromised underground sewer pipe, you’re going to want to drain that particular swamp much faster than a bill becomes a law — and you're gonna need the help of a different kind of pro. While D.C. denizens might be forgiven for having put off sanitary sewer line maintenance, given its substantial expense relative to what your fellow Americans pay, repairs cost much less than the national average so there’s a good chance you’ll be, um … _billed_ back better.

Your sanitary sewer system is a network of underground pipes that does the dirtiest of all household jobs: carrying sewage and greywater out and away from your home. When you brush your teeth, wash the dishes or flush the toilet, that water doesn’t just disappear. Your sewer line is responsible for carrying it to a wastewater treatment plant.

Sewer systems — marvels of modern plumbing — are designed to be out of sight and out of mind. But sometimes, they’ll make themselves known. Gurgling toilets, sewage smells, slow drains and puddles of sewer water in your yard are all symptoms of a sewer line backup. One odd presentation of a sewer-line leak is a particularly (and perhaps suspiciously) green patch of grass in your lawn. Why’s it so green? You can probably fill in the blanks.

In that case, you’re probably going to need repair. That involves digging a trench to access the line, breaking the pipe, removing the damaged section and replacing it with a new one. Trenchless repairs are a little easier (and cheaper) because of the lack of digging involved.

Don’t worry. We’ve anticipated your next question: What’s this bill going to look like?

Sewer line maintenance and repair costs vary wildly based on a number of factors, like the type of pipes you have and whether excavation work is needed. If the technicians are going to have to dig up your yard to get to your sewer line, the total price depends on anything from how deep your lines are buried to what type of soil they’ll have to dig through. And, of course, the local cost of living also plays a factor.

Regular maintenance can help prevent cracks that lead to major repairs, but this, too, comes at a price.

The national average cost for diagnosis is $83 (CAD 106), for maintenance is $408 (CAD 520) and repair is $3,708 (CAD 4,726).

Below, you’ll find the average service prices based on aggregated HomeServe data reported by our network of contractors across the District of Columbia, which should give you a good idea of how much you’ll have to pay for sanitary sewer line maintenance and repairs.

(At the time of publication, pandemic-precipitated materials shortages were impacting home maintenance, repair and construction sectors across the board; price fluctuations caused by those supply-chain issues are not necessarily reflected here.)

Sanitary Sewer Line Diagnosis: $80 (CAD 102)
--------------------------------------------

Before they can get to work on your line, the technician will likely need to come out and run some tests to determine what’s wrong with your system. In Washington, D.C., the fee for this runs about the same as the national average.

Sanitary Sewer Line Maintenance: $542 (CAD 691)
-----------------------------------------------

If you want to avoid a larger sewer system breakdown, you’ll want to stay on top of regular maintenance and cleaning. A maintenance service call usually involves spraying your pipes with high-pressure water to clear any would-be clogs. The technician may also send a scope down the pipe to check for cracks and separations that could cause issues down the road.

In D.C., you can expect to pay around 33% more than the national average for sewer line maintenance. Experts recommend large households have their pipes serviced once every two years.

Sanitary Sewer Line Repair: $2,666 (CAD 3,399)
----------------------------------------------

Shifting earth and invading tree roots can do a number on your sewer pipes. Over time, your pipes may separate or crack, causing leaks and full-on ruptures. Whatever the reason, if a technician says you’re going to need a sewer line repair, you should brace yourself for the accompanying costs.

Washingtonians spend around 28% less than the average American does.
