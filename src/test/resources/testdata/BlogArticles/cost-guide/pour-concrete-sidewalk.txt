  Have the weeds taken control of your concrete sidewalk? Perhaps your walk is just looking tired and worn. In either case, you may wish to have a new sidewalk poured. Concrete sidewalks can last a long time if well maintained, but they may start to show cracks and weather damage over time — especially if weeds are allowed to take hold.

Concrete sidewalk costs can vary significantly depending on the size of the sidewalk and the style or finish you're aiming for. Here’s the rundown on walkway costs.

Concrete Sidewalk Cost Per Square Foot
--------------------------------------

According to [LawnStarter](https://www.lawnstarter.com/blog/cost/concrete-sidewalk-price/), a concrete sidewalk costs between about $6 and $12 CAD (CAD 8 and CAD 16) per square foot on average. Many contractors offer a sidewalk cost calculator that’ll help you work out how much your sidewalk will cost in total.

The total price will include the labor for concrete work and the cost of the materials. Pouring a simple, flat concrete driveway will cost less than pouring and stamping a driveway with a more ornate appearance.

In some cases, you’ll need to take into account additional concrete work costs, such as the cost to remove an existing concrete sidewalk. [Fixr](https://www.fixr.com/costs/concrete-removal) says removing an existing sidewalk can cost between $500 and $5,000 (CAD 680 and CAD 6,800), depending on the size of the area, with the average cost being about $1,860 (CAD 2,500) for a 600-square-foot sidewalk.

How Much Does It Cost to Pour a 12x12 Concrete Slab?
----------------------------------------------------

Concrete walkway costs vary depending on where you live and whether you want stamped concrete or a simple sidewalk replacement. The national average for a 12-foot by 12-foot concrete sidewalk installed by a contractor is between about $850 and $1,730 (CAD 1,150 and CAD 2,350).

It's worth getting several cost estimates and asking for them to be itemized so that you have a clearer idea of how much you expect to pay.

You may be able to keep costs down by filling a small area as a DIY project because the materials cost is just a small part of the job. However, if you've not carried out a sidewalk replacement job before, you may miss important details such as how many inches thick you need the drive to be and how to use wire mesh to smooth out imperfections in the subgrade and reduce the risk of sinkholes.

If you're not well-versed in how to perform sidewalk replacement, bring in a professional who can carry out a replacement that will last many years.

How Much Does It Cost to Pour 200 Square Feet of Concrete?
----------------------------------------------------------

Assuming an average cost of $6 to $12 per square foot, it would cost around $1,200 to $2,400 (CAD 1,600 to CAD 3,250) to have 200 square feet of concrete poured. You can expect to pay a little more than the national average if you want stamped concrete with a fancier appearance.

Caring for Your New Sidewalk
----------------------------

Concrete is durable and hardwearing, but it can become cracked and start to break if weeds are allowed to grow up or if you have a lot of ice build-up in the winter. Taking the time to de-ice your driveway during the coldest months is an important maintenance task. It's also important to kill weeds properly, getting rid of the whole weed — including the roots — so that they can't grow back and damage the concrete. This will help your walkway last as long as possible and reduce the risk of severe cracks or damage.
