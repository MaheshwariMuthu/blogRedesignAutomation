You'll need to take bamboo floor installation costs into consideration and plan which type of bamboo flooring to use.

How Much Does a Bamboo Floor Cost?
----------------------------------

According to [HomeGuide](https://homeguide.com/costs/bamboo-flooring-cost), cost estimates for bamboo flooring can range from $1,400 to $8,500 (CAD 1,915 to CAD 11,626) for 200 to 500 square feet. The average cost range for a 2,000-square-foot home is $14,000 to $34,000 (CAD 19,149 to CAD 46,504).

The average costs for flooring material also vary depending on the type of bamboo flooring you install. They have different characteristics, so taking the time to research and make a plan is worth it. The following pricing information is from [This Old House](https://www.thisoldhouse.com/flooring/reviews/bamboo-flooring-cost).

### Engineered Bamboo Flooring

Made of a thin layer of veneer on top of plywood or fiberboard, engineered bamboo floor costs are typically between $2 and $5.50 (CAD 2.74 and CAD 7.52) per square foot. This type of flooring is known for its durability.

### Strand-Woven Bamboo Flooring

This option is made of woven strands of bamboo that are compressed through pressure and heat. This is the strongest option available, resisting scratches and dings. It also holds its finish well. The price range is $4 to $7.50 (CAD 5.47 to CAD 10.26) per square foot.

### Solid Bamboo Flooring

Also called vertical bamboo flooring, this option doesn't look as much like bamboo as other options. The color is variable, including an option that's smoked to produce a darker grain. Solid flooring resists moisture better than other bamboo flooring, and it's reasonably durable. The price range is $2.50 to $7.50 (CAD 3.42 to CAD 10.26) per square foot.

Is Bamboo Flooring Worth It?
----------------------------

So, is bamboo flooring a good choice for homeowners? You'll have to weigh the pros and cons. Bamboo is good because it's cost-effective, eco-friendly and can be three times more durable than other wood flooring. However, bamboo isn't waterproof, so it can bow and swell, and it gets dings and scratches easily. Also, low-quality bamboo flooring isn't durable.

How Much Does Installation Cost?
--------------------------------

Bamboo flooring installation costs depend on whether you use a contractor or put in the floors yourself.

The costs are easy to figure. According to [HomeGuide](https://homeguide.com/costs/bamboo-flooring-cost), hiring a flooring contractor costs $4 to $9 (CAD 5.47 to CAD 12.31) per square foot.

Factor in an extra $25 to $75 (CAD 34 to CAD 103) per room if you need your installer to move furniture and 70 cents to $1.60 (CAD 0.96 to CAD 2.19) per square foot to remove existing carpet.

That said, going DIY is an appealing option, but you've got to take the proper safety measures. These include wearing safety glasses and establishing a cross-breeze in the work area. The installation involves glues, so you must have good ventilation.

[The Home Depot](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Flooring-Hardwood-Flooring-Bamboo-Flooring/N-5yc1vZbrfe) carries bamboo planks, so buying bamboo flooring is a relatively easy process. Just measure out your square footage and be sure to buy the flooring type that fits your needs.

How Does the Price Compare to Hardwood Floors?
----------------------------------------------

Installation costs for a hardwood floor are generally higher than for bamboo flooring, according to pricing data from [Architectural Digest](https://www.architecturaldigest.com/reviews/flooring/hardwood-flooring-cost#:~:text=The%20national%20average%20cost%20of,additional%20services%20required%20for%20installation.). With the cost of materials and man-hours combined, engineered wood costs $6 to $20 (CAD 8.21 to CAD 27) per square foot, and solid wood costs $6 to $23 (CAD 8.21 to CAD 31) per square foot.

For a 2,500-square-foot house, this equals $15,000 to $50,000 (CAD 20,517 to CAD 68,389) and $15,000 to $57,500 (CAD 20,517 to CAD 78,647), respectively.

If you install hardwood floors yourself, [The Spruce](https://www.thespruce.com/cost-of-solid-hardwood-flooring-estimates-1821867) says you can expect to pay $8 to $17.90 (CAD 10.94 to CAD 24) per square foot. Higher-end bamboo costs are similar, but the economical options are significantly cheaper, even with professional installation.
