  Gutters protect your home against damage caused by rain, snow and falling debris, so installing them is essential if you don't have them already. If your existing gutters are past their prime, it's worth replacing them to avoid potentially costly water damage.

Installing or replacing gutters is an essential expense, but many homeowners worry about the impact on their wallets.

How Much Does Gutter Replacement Cost?
--------------------------------------

According to [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/home-improvement/gutter/gutter-installation-cost/), gutter replacement costs around $2,150 (CAD 2,900) on average. However, you could pay anywhere between $750 and $8,150 (CAD 1,015 and CAD 11,015), depending on the length of the gutters requiring replacement and the height and accessibility of your house. Replacing gutters costs around $100 to $200 (CAD 135 to CAD 270) more than a new installation because you'll have to pay to remove and dispose of your existing gutters.

How Much Does Gutter Installation Cost for a House Without Gutters?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Most homeowners spend between $600 and $8,000 (CAD 810 and CAD 10,815) to install gutters on a house without preexisting gutters, although the national average is around $2,000 (CAD 2,700). These figures are for an average-sized family home requiring up to 200 linear feet of new gutters.

You can get a clearer idea of your project costs by calculating average prices per linear foot of gutter. Gutter installation could cost just $3 (CAD 4) per linear foot if you use budget materials, including professional installation. However, prices can reach up to $40 (CAD 54) per linear foot for premium materials.

What Factors Influence the Cost of Gutter Installation?
-------------------------------------------------------

How much gutter installation costs depends on more than just the size of the project. Understanding how the following factors influence the price can help you prepare for unexpected costs.

### Labor

Labor accounts for a significant proportion of the cost of gutter installation, with most contractors charging around $75 (CAD 100) per hour. Installing gutters usually takes up to 8 hours, but it could take longer if your house is particularly tall or large.

The cost of living can also impact how much a gutter installation company charges. Prices can start from around $2 (CAD 2.70) per linear foot in affordable areas but may reach $7 (CAD 9) per linear foot in expensive cities.

Bear in mind that contractors often charge additional fees if the installation is challenging or dangerous. For example, you may pay more if there are trees or power lines obstructing the area or you have a multistory building.

### Material

The material used to make your gutters can also affect the cost. Vinyl gutters are the most affordable, costing between $2 and $6 (CAD 2.70 and CAD 8) per linear foot for materials without installation labor. Aluminum gutters are also relatively inexpensive at $2 to $10 (CAD 2.70 to CAD 13) per linear foot.

Galvanized steel gutters are a durable midrange option, costing between $5 and $12 (CAD 7 and CAD 16) per linear foot. At the top end of the scale, zinc gutters could cost as much as $40 (CAD 54) per linear foot.

### Gutter Type

The two main types of gutters are sectional and seamless. As the name suggests, sectional gutters come in pieces. They're cheaper to install at $3 to $38 (CAD 4 to CAD 51) per linear foot, including labor, but they're less durable than seamless gutters. Expect to spend between $6 and $45 (CAD 8 and CAD 60) per linear foot on seamless gutters.

The style can also affect the overall cost. Standard U-shaped gutters cost between $3 and $34 (CAD 4 and CAD 46) per linear foot, but there are several other options available.

### Downspouts

You'll need to install downspouts at least every 40 feet to drain water away from your house. How much downspouts cost depends on the material, length and design, but most homeowners spend between $5 and $20 (CAD 7 and CAD 27) per linear foot.
