Converting a small bathroom to a wet room would cost less than converting a much larger space, but how much does a wet room cost to install, and is it worth the investment?

How Much Does a Wet Room Cost?
------------------------------

According to [Real Homes](https://www.realhomes.com/advice/how-to-create-a-wetroom), installing a wet room costs between $7,000 and $40,000 9CAD 9,400 and CAD 54,000) — around 20% to 30% more than installing a standard bathroom. This includes the materials and labor. The price also takes into consideration the likelihood that you’ll need planning permissions or permits.

Remember that the cost of fitting a wet room doesn't just relate to the cost of the wall and floor. You'll also need a shower screen. Plus, many people take the opportunity to install underfloor heating or other luxuries while they're doing up their shower area. There are additional materials and labor costs associated with these extras.

Is a Walk-in Shower the Same as a Wet Room?
-------------------------------------------

Wet rooms and walk-in showers are similar in that they both offer homeowners a spacious way to shower. The difference is the scope of the waterproofing and the way the floor is designed. A walk-in shower has a large shower tray, while a wet room has an entirely waterproof floor that extends underneath the vanity and toilet as well.

Wet rooms are popular with people who have small bathrooms and who want to maximize the available space. They're also good for those who have mobility issues.

Benefits of a Wet Room
----------------------

If you're considering a shower remodel, converting your existing bathroom into a wet room could give the illusion of more space. Here are some additional benefits:

*   Because they’re waterproof, top to bottom, they’re easy to clean.
*   The lack of a lip makes it easy to get in and out of the shower. Depending on the design, they may be wheelchair accessible.
*   Wet rooms can have radiant floor heating.
*   The open appearance makes the room look more inviting.

Does a Wet Room Add Value to Your Home?
---------------------------------------

To get the best resale value, it’s important that your home has at least one bathtub. You may not want to convert your only bathroom with a tub into a wet room. That said, installing a wet room in a second or third bathroom may make your home more appealing to some buyers and, therefore, add value to your home.

It's important to have the wet room properly fitted by professionals and to make sure you obtain any relevant planning permissions and that the room complies with local building regulations.

Poorly fitted wet rooms can leak and cause costly damage to your property. To avoid this, make sure your wet room flooring is watertight, that good quality tile adhesive is used, and that the plumbing is properly tested. Poor seals around the floor or porous tiles could lead to problems down the road. Paying for professional shower installation helps you avoid issues that might reduce the return you see on your investment.
