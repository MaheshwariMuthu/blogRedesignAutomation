  Whether you want to swim some laps for exercise or host the party of the summer, an inground pool can make an excellent addition to your property. Unlike above-ground pools, inground pools are permanent fixtures, so you want to make sure you have all the information you need to make an informed decision about this investment for your property and family.

Learn about the different types of inground pools and how much your project may cost.

Inground Pool Costs
-------------------

The cost of an inground pool can vary based on a number of factors, but according to [HomeGuide](https://homeguide.com/costs/inground-pool-cost),﻿ inground pools typically cost between $25,000 and $100,000 (CAD 33,924 and CAD 135,697).

However, this is just the cost of the initial installation. Inground pools require regular maintenance and upkeep throughout their entire lifetime, and repairs can also add to the costs.

It'll cost you more to build a more customized pool or one with additional features. The permits and property taxes that come with adding an inground pool to your property may also increase the costs.

How Does the Cost Vary by Size?
-------------------------------

It makes sense that smaller pools cost less to install than larger ones. For example, a 12-foot by 24-foot pool is a standard, relatively small inground pool size that can cost you between $23,000 and $72,000 (CAD 16,284 and CAD 97,702), depending on the type of materials used.

In addition to the size of the pool, shape also matters when determining costs. Inground pools can be freeform or geometric. Freeform pools can be custom shaped to fit into your property's natural contours, while geometric pools are usually rectangular. Geometric and oval-shaped pools are generally the most cost-effective option because they're relatively straightforward to construct. Freeform pools have a greater potential for additional construction costs due to their complexity and are usually more expensive.

How Does the Cost Vary by Material?
-----------------------------------

Your inground pool costs are largely dependent on the type of material used to construct the pool. There are three main types of materials used for inground swimming pools.

### Concrete

Concrete pools have fairly steep average costs, which range from $50,000 to $120,000 (CAD 67,849 to CAD 162,836), according to [HomeGuide](https://homeguide.com/costs/inground-pool-cost). These types of pools are the most easily customizable of the three, and they can vary significantly in terms of size, shape and design. Beyond the up-front pool installation cost, concrete pools usually require major renovation every few decades.

### Fiberglass

Fiberglass pool costs are also quite high, averaging between $30,000 and $85,000 (CAD 40,709 and CAD 115,342), although they're usually cheaper to build than concrete pools. On the other hand, fiberglass inground pools typically have lower maintenance costs over their lifetime. They're usually quicker to install and have built-in seating molded into the shell. Potential drawbacks to fiberglass pools include limited shaping and design customization and restrictions on pool size.

### Vinyl

Vinyl pools are the least costly option for an inground pool, with average costs ranging from $25,000 to $65,000﻿ (CAD 33,924 to CAD 88,203). Vinyl pools can come in all shapes and sizes and can take just a few weeks to install. However, vinyl pools are subject to higher maintenance costs due to the fragility of the liner. These pools require you to be more cautious during use so you don't damage the liner.

How Much Does Labor Cost?
-------------------------

Like other costs associated with inground pools, labor isn't a fixed cost, and it varies based on a number of factors. According to [Bob Vila](https://www.bobvila.com/articles/inground-pool-cost/), on average, labor costs account for roughly 33% of the total cost of the inground pool installation or around $19,000 (CAD 25,782) on average.

Your home's location plays a role in labor costs for your pool installation. [Pool Contractor](https://www.poolcontractor.com/how-much-does-it-cost-to-install-an-inground-pool/) says people in northern states pay more for inground swimming pool installation labor costs than people in southern states. Midwestern states have the lowest labor costs for inground pool installation, while Hawaii has the highest labor costs.

What Are Some Other Cost Factors to Consider?
---------------------------------------------

Inground pools aren't one-time expenses; they're lifetime investments. Even a small inground pool requires care and maintenance that can quickly add up over time. Some pools, such as vinyl inground pools, are more susceptible to damage, and repair costs must be factored into your total pool costs. Features and benefits, such as slides, heaters and fences, also contribute to your overall costs.
