Learn about the different types of inground pools and how much your project may cost.

Inground Pool Costs
-------------------

The cost of an inground pool can vary based on a number of factors, but according to [Family Handyman,](https://www.familyhandyman.com/article/above-ground-vs-inground-pool/) inground pools typically cost between $30,000 and $70,000 (CAD 39,000 to CAD 91,000).

However, this is just the cost for the initial installation. Inground pools require regular maintenance and upkeep throughout their entire lifetime, and repairs can also add to the costs.

It will cost you more to build a more customized pool or one with additional features. The permits and property taxes that come with adding an inground pool to your property may also add to costs.

How Does the Cost Vary by Size?
-------------------------------

It makes sense that smaller pools cost less to install than larger ones. For example, a 12-foot by 24-foot pool is a standard, relatively small inground pool size that can cost you between [$25,000 and $50,000](https://www.poolcontractor.com/pool-contractor/how-much-does-a-12x24-inground-pool-cost/) (CAD 33,000 and CAD 65,000), depending on the type of materials used.

In addition to the size of the pool, shape also matters when determining costs. Inground pools can be freeform or geometric. Freeform pools can be custom shaped to fit into your property's natural contours. Geometric pools are usually rectangular and are much more straightforward to construct. Generally, there's [no major cost difference](https://theknowledgeburrow.com/which-pool-shape-is-cheapest/) between freeform and geometric pools; however, freeform pools have a greater potential for additional construction costs due to their complexity.

How Does the Cost Vary by Material?
-----------------------------------

Your inground pool costs are largely dependent on the type of material used to construct the pool. There are three main types of materials used for inground swimming pools.

### Concrete

Concrete pools have fairly steep average costs, which range from $50,000 to $100,000 (CAD 65,000 to CAD 130,000), according to [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/home-improvement/inground-pool-cost/). These types of pools are the most easily customizable of the three, and they can vary significantly in terms of size, shape and design. Beyond the upfront pool installation cost, concrete pools usually require major renovation every few decades.

### Fiberglass

Fiberglass pool costs are also quite high, averaging between $45,000 and $85,000 (CAD 69,000 and CAD 111,000), based on data from [Fixr](https://www.fixr.com/costs/in-ground-fiberglass-swimming-pool). However, fiberglass inground pools typically have lower maintenance costs over their lifetime. They are usually quicker to install and have built-in seating molded into the shell. Potential drawbacks to fiberglass pools include limited shaping and design customization and restrictions on pool size.

### Vinyl

Vinyl pools are the least costly option for an inground pool, with average costs ranging from [$35,000 to $65,000](https://www.fixr.com/costs/inground-vinyl-liner-swimming-pool) (CAD 46,000 to CAD 85,000). Vinyl pools can come in all shapes and sizes and can take just a few weeks to install. However, vinyl pools are subject to higher maintenance costs due to the fragility of the liner. These pools require you to be more cautious during use, so you don't damage the liner.

How Much Does Labor Cost?
-------------------------

Like other costs associated with inground pools, labor is not a fixed cost, and it varies based on a number of factors. On average, labor costs account for 25% to 50% of the total cost of the inground pool installation, according to [Bob Vila](https://www.bobvila.com/articles/how-much-does-it-cost-to-build-a-pool/).

Your home's location plays a role in labor costs for your pool installation. [Pool Contractor](https://www.poolcontractor.com/how-much-does-it-cost-to-install-an-inground-pool/) says people in northern states pay more for inground swimming pool installation labor costs than people in southern states. Midwestern states have the lowest labor costs for inground pool installation, while Hawaii has the highest labor costs.

What Are Some Other Cost Factors to Consider?
---------------------------------------------

Inground pools are not one-time expenses; they're lifetime investments. Even a small inground pool requires care and maintenance that can quickly add up over time. Some pools, such as vinyl inground pools, are more susceptible to damage, and repair costs must be factored into your total pool costs. Features and benefits, such as slides, heaters and fences also contribute to your overall costs.<br><iframe title="YouTube video player" width="1072" height="603" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ut21k0-1KZQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen title="Water Line Repair and Replacement | What You Can Expect to Pay"></iframe>
