Installing an above-ground pool can be a DIY project, which will save you money on installation costs. Or you can opt to call a professional. Get the job done, and you'll be among the privileged company of pool owners who can take a dip anytime they want by simply stepping into their backyard.

Above-Ground Pool Costs
-----------------------

According to [HomeGuide](https://homeguide.com/costs/above-ground-pool-cost), you can expect an above-ground pool kit to cost anywhere from $850 to $8,200 (CAD 1,163 to CAD 11,216). The cheapest above-ground pool kits start at about $400 (CAD 547) for an inflatable pool, according to [The Spruce](https://www.thespruce.com/above-ground-pool-cost-4847129).

### Installation

Professional above-ground pool installation costs $750 to $3,000 (CAD 1,026 to CAD 4,103). The process takes about two days.

Installing the pool yourself is not difficult, as kits designed for DIYers are available online. And they come with instructions that are easy to follow. As with any DIY project, safety is essential. It's important to be careful to avoid injury when installing your pool.

### Pool Add-ons

Buying a kit from a more expensive brand can add to the cost, as can the pool depth, size of the pool and additional features. Additions like a waterfall, heaters or pool enclosures can add anywhere from $750 to $8,000 (CAD 1,026 to CAD 10,942) to above-ground pool prices.

You may need to hire a landscaper to adjust the slope or grade of your yard to prepare the space for the pool, which also contributes to the cost. According to [HomeGuide](https://homeguide.com/costs/cost-to-level-or-regrade-yard)﻿, with most jobs, you can expect to pay an additional $200 to $850 (CAD 274 to CAD 1,163).

High-end pools with the most expensive materials and plenty of features can cost as much as $11,200 (CAD 15,319) when professionally installed by a pool company. On the other hand, the cheapest in-ground pools cost much less to purchase and install but may only last a single season. However, they're an economical choice if you don’t intend to build a permanent pool.

There are kits for above-ground lap pools. You'll need a long, narrow space in your yard to install one. Another option is a saltwater pool, which gives you an alternative to chlorine pools.

What Factors Affect the Cost?
-----------------------------

You can expect to pay more for any added features. You'll need to specify which type of above-ground pool you want to build. In general, you'll need to make some decisions on pool size, pool shape and whether you want to add a pool heater.

All these factors influence the price, and pools are very customizable. So, sitting down and making a plan for which features you want in your pool and calculating the costs will prepare you for the installation.

Considering the longer-term investment value for your pool is worthwhile. The material of the pool has a major impact on how long it will last. Installing hard-sided above-ground pools can be worth the additional cost due to their long-term value.

There are many options, including inflatable, resin or metal pools. Metal pools will generally last 7 to 15 years, making your investment worthwhile. You'll have to make the choice between different metals, with options like steel and aluminum.

If you're not sure whether an above-ground option is right for you, it can help to get an idea of the requirements for and costs of installing and maintaining other types of pools, like inground and semi-inground pools.

How Much Does It Cost to Install an Above-Ground Pool With a Deck?
------------------------------------------------------------------

The cost to build a pool with a deck is higher than the pool alone. You can expect to spend an additional $2,800 to $10,000 (CAD 3,830 to CAD 13,678) or more to install a deck around an above-ground pool. Contractors can build both together, with [HomeGuide﻿](https://homeguide.com/costs/above-ground-pool-cost) reporting that above-ground pools with deck packages could run you anywhere from $2,500 to $11,200 (CAD 3,419 to CAD 15,319).

Alternatively, you could consider building the deck yourself using a deck kit. Smaller kits suitable for DIY installation typically cost between $2,000 and $4,000 (CAD 2,736 and CAD 5,471). Safety is more of an issue if you're adding a deck on a DIY basis. Hammering in nails, maneuvering boards and using stains must be done with safety in mind. Wear safety glasses, use work gloves to protect your hands and stain boards in a well-ventilated space.
