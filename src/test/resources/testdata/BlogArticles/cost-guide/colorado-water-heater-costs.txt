  After a morning carving up those Colorado slopes, all you wanna do when you get home is drop your bibs and soak in a hot, steamy bath. But if you’ve neglected water heater maintenance, that cozy little at-home-ski-lodge scene you have in your head is gonna be much chillier than you’d imagined. Not only can you not simply call the innkeeper to move to a room with working hot water — you’re gonna have to pay someone to fix this. Calm down, Coloradans: Notwithstanding that famed Rocky Mountain high, water heater repair and replacement costs are relatively low. According to our estimates, it costs less to repair or replace your water heater in the Centennial State than the national average.

Your water heater is a pretty important piece of equipment. It’s responsible for your clean clothes, spotless dishes and that hot shower you’re looking forward to. When it goes kaput, it's not so much a matter of _whether_ you should have it serviced, but how much that service will cost. And if your hot water is already out, the last thing you want is to be slapped with sky-high service fees. Curious what it might cost? These figures should give you a ballpark idea of how much you can expect to pay, from the plains to the plateau.

Repair and replacement costs vary depending on where you live. For comparison, the national average for diagnosis is $99, for repair is $493 and for replacement is $1,741.

The following average prices are based on aggregated HomeServe data reported by our network of contractors across Colorado.

Water Heater Diagnosis: $92
---------------------------

The diagnostic fee is what the technician will charge you to tell you what’s wrong with your system and whether it needs to be repaired or replaced. In Colorado, this fee is about 7% lower than the national average.

Water Heater Repair: $283
-------------------------

Any of a number of things may be going wrong with your water heater — issues with the gas control valve, a faulty thermostat or a combination of several malfunctions. This average repair price includes replacement parts and the labor to install them. Repairs cost Coloradans an average of 43% less than the U.S. overall.

Water Heater Replace: $1,535
----------------------------

Water heaters don’t last forever, and a breakdown might be a sign that yours is on its way out. At the end of your water heater’s usable life (about 10 years), you'll need to spring for a new one. Colorado’s average replacement price is 12% less than the nation’s.

(Note that HomeServe water heater data should generally be assumed to refer to conventional “tanked” models — the most common type — as opposed to tankless or “on-demand” models, which can cost roughly twice as much.)
