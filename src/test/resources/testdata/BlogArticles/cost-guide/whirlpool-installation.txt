While it's easy to get caught up in the luxury of it all, pricing out your jetted tub installation can be a total reality check. A whirlpool tub installation can bring a hefty cost, especially if you're going to hire a professional. Here’s everything you need to know.

How Much Does a Jetted Tub Cost?
--------------------------------

The cost of the tub itself varies based on its size and style, as well as the number of jets you want. On the lower end of the price range, you can find a basic model for about $800 (CAD 1,030), according to [HomeGuide](https://homeguide.com/costs/hot-tub-prices#jetted). Expect to pay between $800 and $3,000 (CAD 1,030 and CAD 3,900) on average.

Luxury brands can cost as much as $7,500 (CAD 9,700). Or, if you desire a more luxurious, walk-in model with massage features, the price increases to between $2,000 and $12,000 (CAD 2,600 and CAD 15,500).

Installing a tub costs $6,500 (CAD 8,400) on average. However, once you factor in costs for wiring the jets or expanding the bath floor, the price can quickly mount up to $17,000 (CAD 21,900), according to [Bob Vila](https://www.bobvila.com/articles/how-much-does-it-cost-to-replace-a-bathtub/). The cost of having a professional come in to install your tub will also vary based on where you live.

### Factors Influencing Cost

Based on your budget, you can make decisions about your whirlpool tub that work for your wallet and still allow you to have the bathroom of your dreams. You do have some control over the cost of your jetted tub installation based on:

*   The size of the tub
*   The shape of the tub
*   If the existing framing in your bathroom can support the tub
*   Additional water heater considerations
*   The voltage the tub requires
*   Whether you install it yourself or hire a professional

Does a Whirlpool Tub Add Value to a Home?
-----------------------------------------

While a whirlpool bathtub is a lovely feature for your home, you should only install a whirlpool tub because you want one — not because you're hoping to add value to your home. Though a jetted tub is more luxurious than a regular bathtub, it's unlikely that it will impact an appraisal of your home's resale value in any significant way.

When you consider this, along with the cost to install a whirlpool bath, the plumbing, the electrical bills and the potential bathroom remodeling that goes along with it, a jetted tub is likely to be an investment on which you won’t see much of a return in the long run. But if you're making improvements to your forever home, go for it.

Is It Difficult to Install a Whirlpool Tub?
-------------------------------------------

Installing a whirlpool tub is not extremely difficult, but it’s more involved than the average DIY project. The biggest factor that complicates installation is the tub frame. Will the jetted tub have sides that require framing, or will your existing framing fit the new tub's dimensions? Many whirlpool tub manufacturers advise against installing the product yourself because of the [specific electrical codes](https://www.nfpa.org/codes-and-standards/all-codes-and-standards/list-of-codes-and-standards/detail?code=70) that you must adhere to.

It's critical to consider that a whirlpool tub requires its own dedicated electrical circuit. If it also requires its own water heater, that will demand a separate circuit on your service panel, too. Tubs requiring a 240-volt circuit should be connected directly to the power supply. It's best to hire a general contractor or electrician to handle the electrical aspects to ensure you're abiding by electrical codes. A whirlpool tub comes as a self-contained unit, so the plus side is that there is no additional plumbing work required.

How a Whirlpool Tub Affects Your Utility Costs
----------------------------------------------

A whirlpool tub is the ultimate place to unwind after a long day, but the operating costs are important to consider before the installation begins. Even if you keep your installation costs low, your utility bill will reflect the increase in water and power usage each billing cycle.

Jetted tubs typically require more water to fill completely for soaking, and the jets will require more hot water than a regular bathtub. If your tub has its own water heater, this will increase the cost as well. Because your tub is connected to your electrical circuit and using it is pretty taxing on your water heater, you could be looking at roughly [$20 to $30](https://homeguide.com/costs/hot-tub-prices#month) (CAD 25 to CAD 40) extra per month in utility costs.
