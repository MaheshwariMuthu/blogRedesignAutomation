  Your backyard is a place of relaxation and enjoyment. It’s an area where the family can gather and enjoy nature without having to stray too far from home. Family barbecues, swimming and outdoor games are just some of the ways to spend time enjoying the outdoors at your home. Another way — especially if you have children — is with a backyard trampoline.

How much does it cost to install one? While this might sound like a fairly straightforward question, there’s a significant cost variance between the two main types of trampolines: above-ground and inground.

Above-Ground Trampolines
------------------------

If you decide to go for an above-ground trampoline, you have a couple of options. The first is to simply set up the trampoline yourself in a safe flat space in your backyard. Depending on weather conditions and your yard, the only cost associated with this method would be the price of the trampoline itself.

The next option is similar in that you’re putting the trampoline in a safe place above ground, but you go the extra step of staking it into the ground. This makes the trampoline a little more secure and resistant to adverse conditions. However, it’s less mobile, which can make lawn maintenance difficult. For this type of installation, the cost is relatively the same: just the price of the trampoline. You’ll also have to buy some stakes. Depending on your yard and your trampoline, staking options vary. Check your local hardware store to see which will be best.

Above-Ground Trampoline Cost
----------------------------

According to [Springfree Trampoline](https://www.springfreetrampoline.com/blog/trampoline-cost/), the trampoline kit itself can range from about $200 to $4,000 (CAD 266 to CAD 5,315), depending on size and materials. The cost of professional installation will vary as well, but after it’s all said and done, the total project cost will likely fall somewhere between $300 and $4,500 (CAD 399 and CAD 5,979), depending on the size of your trampoline and whether you install it yourself or hire a pro.

Inground Trampoline
-------------------

The next option is the more permanent and, thus, the more expensive — an inground trampoline. If you’re unfamiliar with an inground trampoline, think of it as being similar to an inground swimming pool. There’s a little more work involved in setting it up, but it provides a much different experience than one that’s above ground.

### Are Inground Trampolines Worth It?

Installing an inground trampoline in your backyard can have numerous advantages. First, it’s more secure. By taking the time to install it in the ground, you know it’s not going to move around while in use. This can also have safety advantages. Typically, an inground trampoline has a jumping surface flush with the rest of the yard, so jumpers won’t fall as far to the ground in an accident. Safety nets can still be used with inground trampolines.

There’s also the yard maintenance factor. With inground trampolines, you won’t have to move them to mow or landscape. A sunken trampoline can add fun to your backyard without adding an eyesore to your line of sight. Being flush with the ground gives it a much neater appearance.

Speaking of maintenance: There’s a little more upkeep involved with inground trampoline in the form of preventative maintenance. We’ll get more into that below.

Inground Trampoline Cost
------------------------

According to Springfree Trampoline, you’ll spend slightly more for an inground trampoline kit than you would for an above-ground kit — $1,000 to $5,000 (CAD 1,329 to CAD 6,644). However, you’re probably going to have to hire someone to dig a hole. [Get Trampoline](https://www.gettrampoline.com/trampoline-articles/in-ground-trampoline/#tab-con-10) says excavation costs $400 to $1,500 (CAD 532 to CAD 1,993), but prices may be higher if the ground is not soft. Lastly, you’ll need to build a retaining wall in the hole, which costs an additional $2,000 (CAD 2,658) for an average 14-foot (4.25-meter) trampoline.

Inground Trampoline Cost Factors
--------------------------------

### Hole Depth

How deep do you have to dig for an inground trampoline?  Typically, the installation of an inground trampoline will involve digging out an area that is roughly the length, width and height of the trampoline. The actual size of the hole is going to vary based on the type and size of trampoline kit you purchase, according to [Get Trampoline](https://www.gettrampoline.com/in-ground/digging-hole-for-trampoline-pit/#tab-con-5) — which will also impact cost. A 14-foot trampoline will need a hole that’s about 3 feet (1 meter) deep.

### Finishing Stones and Retaining Walls

Once the area is dug, you can then choose to partially fill it, finish it off, or leave it as packed dirt. Be aware, though, that without something over the dirt, some kind of vegetation will eventually grow. In most cases, the area can be finished off with gravel, brick, finishing stones or cement for best results. As we mentioned, you’ll need to build some kind of retaining wall to help maintain the shape, and that comes with its own cost. A wooden retaining wall will be cheaper than a concrete one.

### Water Issues

Keep in mind that with any digging project, there is the potential issue of water flooding the hole. Depending on the type of soil, you’ll need to work in some kind of drainage system to remove any standing water that might accumulate. These can range from simple soil drainage to the equivalent of a sewer system based on the conditions at your home.

Also, you’ll want to make sure your trampoline kit is one that features a galvanized steel frame. This will help prevent rust and keep the system in peak shape.
