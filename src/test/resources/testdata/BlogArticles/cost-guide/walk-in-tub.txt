  If you find it challenging to climb in and out of a standard bath, a walk-in tub could be an excellent alternative.

Walk-in tubs can make bathing significantly safer — especially if you or someone in your household has mobility issues — but it's essential to understand the costs involved before starting your project.

**What Is a Walk-In Bathtub?**
------------------------------

Unlike a regular tub with a fixed wall, a walk-in tub has a door to make it more accessible for people with mobility issues. You can enter and exit safely through the door without having to climb over the bathtub wall. The door creates a watertight seal when you shut it to prevent water from leaking onto the bathroom floor.

Some walk-in bathtubs are deep enough to accommodate an integrated seat. You can also add extra features, such as whirlpool jets and showers.

**How Much Does a Walk-In Tub Cost?**
-------------------------------------

According to data from [Fixr](https://www.fixr.com/costs/walk-in-tub-installation), it typically costs between $5,000 and $8,500 (CAD 6,600 and CAD 11,300) to install a midrange walk-in tub. However, you could spend as little as $3,500 (CAD 4,600) for a basic model without any bells and whistles.

**How Much Does a Walk-In Tub and Shower Combo Cost?**
------------------------------------------------------

If you want to install a shower above your walk-in tub, you have a couple of options. Some units come as a single piece, with shower walls preinstalled around the tub. Alternatively, you could consider installing a regular walk-in tub and adding a custom shower to the adjacent wall.

Whichever option you choose, you'll likely need to spend around $9,000 and $13,000 (CAD 11,900 and CAD 17,200) in total, including professional installation costs.

**Factors That Impact Cost**
----------------------------

Various factors can impact how much a walk-in tub costs to purchase and install. Considering the following factors can help you choose the best option for your needs and budget:

### Custom Features and Accessories

One of the primary factors affecting your project costs is whether you want custom features. Some custom features — like therapeutic jets — create a more luxurious experience, while others — like slip-resistant surfaces and grab bars — help improve safety by preventing slips, falls or scalds.

Many premium walk-in tubs include some of these features as standard, but you can pay a contractor to add them to a more basic model to customize it to your needs. [Kohler Walk-In Bath](https://www.kohlerwalkinbath.com/price-cost/) says accessories and luxe extras can add $1,000 to $5,000 (CAD 1,300 to CAD 6,700) to the price.

### Material

Typically, walk-in tubs are made from acrylic or gelcoat. Acrylic is the most common material, and manufacturers usually reinforce these tubs with fiberglass to improve strength and insulation. Expect to pay between [$2,500 and $13,500](https://www.fixr.com/costs/walk-in-tub-installation#acrylic-walk-in-tub) (CAD 3,300 and $18,000) to install an acrylic walk-in tub.

Gelcoat tubs are easier to clean than acrylic tubs. However, they're also more uncommon, so you may not have as many options if you choose this material. Gelcoat walk-in tubs cost between [$2,500 and $8,000](https://www.fixr.com/costs/walk-in-tub-installation#walk-in-bathtub-costs-by-material) (CAD 3,300 and CAD 10,700), including installation.

### Tub Type

Soaking walk-in tubs cost the least to install because they don't feature jets or other advanced features. Since they don't require complex plumbing or electrical work to install, they generally cost between $2,300 and $7,000 (CAD 3,000 and CAD 9,300), including labor, according to [Modernize](https://modernize.com/walk-in-tubs/cost-guide).

Other common types include:

* **Wheelchair accessible tub:** $3,500 to $11,500 (CAD 4,700 to CAD 15,300)
* **Hydrotherapy tub:** $4,400 to $10,500 (CAD 5,900 to CAD 14,000)
* **Bariatric tub:** $4,200 to $11,500 (CAD 5,600 to CAD 15,300)
