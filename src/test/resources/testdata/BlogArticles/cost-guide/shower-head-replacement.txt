  There are few feelings as blissful as a refreshing shower. If your showerhead is old or scaled over and cleaning it doesn't improve the flow, installing a new one could restore your shower to its former glory. The cost to replace a showerhead could be lower than you think, too.

Whether your showerhead is running low on pressure or you're looking for a more luxurious option, you might be able to install a new showerhead for under $200. Here are the details.

Price Range for a New Showerhead
--------------------------------

A new showerhead is a cost-effective and simple repair that can make your shower perform like new. According to [USA Today](https://reviewed.usatoday.com/home-outdoors/best-right-now/the-best-showerheads), you can expect to pay anywhere from $20 and more than $300 (CAD 27 to CAD 400) for a new showerhead.

A simple showerhead can cost as little as $20, according to [Bob Vila,](https://www.bobvila.com/articles/shower-remodel-cost/) but more appealing showerheads or ones that have sophisticated features, such as uniform flow and temperature, can cost several hundred dollars.

If you're hoping to improve the look of your bathroom and the performance of your shower, you might want to spend a little extra on replacing the faucet as well. You can also install a showerhead made of a high-quality material, such as spot-resistant brushed nickel. These showerheads are easier to keep clean, look stunning and can complete the look of your bathroom.

Why Should You Replace the Showerhead?
--------------------------------------

If your existing showerhead is leaking, damaged or lacks the features you want from your shower, installing a new showerhead makes sense. Not all shower-related problems stem from the head, however. In some cases, you'll need a new line or valve to improve water pressure.

If you're not sure what's causing the problems you're experiencing with your shower, consider talking to a plumber. Some repair jobs are simple enough for general contractors to handle or for an enthusiastic DIYer to take on themselves. Others are best left to the professionals.

Before you spend money, take a look at your existing showerhead. You may be able to clean or repair it instead of purchasing a new one. Limescale buildup in a showerhead can cause a lot of flow-related problems that are easy to fix.

If you still have the documentation for your existing showerhead, check to see if it came with a limited lifetime warranty. With luck, the fault you're experiencing will be covered, and you can get your shower working at full performance without spending a lot of money.

How Much Does a Plumber Charge to Replace a Showerhead?
-------------------------------------------------------

The cost to change a showerhead is fairly minimal; it usually just includes the price of the showerhead itself and the labor cost. Most plumbers can install a showerhead for about $75 to $150 (CAD 100 to CAD 200), according to [The Home Depot](https://www.homedepot.com/services/c/shower-head-replacement/678ceba2e).

As with most home improvement projects, the cost depends on the job size. While the plumber is at your house, you may have them upgrade additional fixtures or complete other repairs. This could help keep the total cost of your plumbing projects down, which frees up money for other things, such as upgrading the shower.
