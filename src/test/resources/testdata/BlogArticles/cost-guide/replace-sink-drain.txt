  Sink drains get a lot of use and abuse. Kitchen sinks have to cope with grimy water, harsh detergents and the strain of being scrubbed and scratched by utensils. Bathroom drains also get exposed to all manner of cleaning agents, plus they catch hair, debris and sometimes glitter or other potential clogging hazards from cosmetics.

The cost to replace a sink drain is an unwelcome expense, but it may be necessary if you have plumbing issues that a simple unclogging won’t fix.

How Much Does It Cost to Install a Bathroom Sink Drain?
-------------------------------------------------------

According to data from [HomeGuide](https://homeguide.com/costs/sink-installation-cost), the average cost to replace a drain is between $100 to $350 (CAD 133 to CAD 464) for a reasonably simple pipe replacement job. There are several things that can increase the cost of this, however. For example, pipes that run under or behind a shower may be much more expensive to replace if the work requires rerouting the pipe or temporarily removing or unhooking those existing fixtures.

In some cases, accessing a pipe may require damaging a shower enclosure or bathtub, which makes the job more expensive. If the bathtub or shower needs to be replaced because of this work, [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/home-improvement/bathroom/cost-to-replace-bathtub/#:~:text=When%20it%20comes%20time%20to,cost%20to%20replace%20a%20bathtub.) says the cost of the job could be as much as $5,600 (CAD 7,431).

How Much Does It Cost to Install a Kitchen Sink Drain?
------------------------------------------------------

Kitchen sink drain installation fees are usually in line with the $100 to $350 (CAD 133 to CAD 464) listed above. This assumes that there is no sink drain at the moment or that the drain needs to be moved to a new location. A simple like-for-like replacement is much easier and would cost far less.

How Much Does It Cost to Replace a Sink Drainpipe?
--------------------------------------------------

According to [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/home-improvement/plumbing/drain-pipe-repair-replacement-cost/#:~:text=Cost%20of%20Drain%20Pipe%20Repair%20and%20Replacement,-When%20it%20comes&text=You%20can%20estimate%20an%20average,range%20of%20%2415%2C000%20to%20%2420%2C000.), the cost of repairing or replacing a sink drainpipe in a kitchen can be as low as $250 (CAD 332), according to Forbes. This job is usually far simpler than installing sink drains in a bathroom because the pipes are usually readily accessible, and the job doesn't take long.

The cost of materials for this kind of job is low. Replacing a sink drainpipe usually takes less than one hour, so homeowners will usually either pay a fixed charge or the minimum fee charged by the plumber or contractor.

How Can I Make My Sink Drain Last Longer?
-----------------------------------------

If you can keep your sink drain clean and obstruction-free, you'll be able to avoid replacing it for much longer. Avoid chemical drain cleaners where possible because these can damage your pipes. Consider using a strainer over your plug to keep the drain from getting clogged and to avoid mishaps such as valuable items getting washed down the drain.
