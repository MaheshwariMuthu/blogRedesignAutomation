The disruption in air pressure prevents wind from entering homes and structures, which can lead to damaged roofs and interiors. If you live in a region where hurricanes are common, you should consider installing hurricane shutters. Wondering how much they cost? Here’s what you need to know.

Hurricane Shutter Cost by Type
------------------------------

This comprehensive list provides information on the different types of hurricane shutters and their approximate costs. In addition to specific costs for the shutters themselves, Porch.com says you can expect to pay between $40 and $100 (CAD 53 and CAD 133) per hour for labor costs.

### Accordion

Accordion shutters are a good option for homeowners who prefer a permanent shutter option. These shutters are designed with aluminum and installed permanently. The shutters get their name because they fold up and give an accordion-like appearance when not in use. The average cost for accordion shutters ranges between $15 and $25 (CAD 20 and CAD 33) per square foot, based on data from [Porch.com](https://pro.porch.com/project-cost/cost-to-install-hurricane-shutters).

### Roll-down

Roll-down hurricane shutters are crafted with sturdy aluminum that can withstand gale-force winds. Roll-down shutters pull down and move along a track to provide coverage from hurricanes and then fold up into slats when not in use. The shutters can be operated manually or through an electric motor. On average, roll-down shutters cost $25 to $45 (CAD 33 to CAD 60).

### Electric

Electric hurricane shutters are sometimes referred to as automatic shutters. The shutters are available in both roll-down shades and screens, and they operate via electric motors. Homeowners can easily put the shutters in place with a quick flip of a switch, and the durable aluminum material can withstand winds up to [130 miles per hour](https://regencydrt.com/hurricane-shutters-what-you-need-to-know/). [HomeGuide](https://homeguide.com/costs/hurricane-shutters-cost) says electric shutters run $350 to $1,225 (CAD 465 to CAD 1,628) per window.

### Colonial

Colonial shutters are a stylish option with the added bonus of hurricane protection. The shutters have a classic slat design and swing open and closed from the sides. Colonial shutters come in aluminum, fiberglass or composite wood and range in cost from $18 to $30 (CAD 24 to CAD 40) per square foot.

### Storm Panel

Storm panels are typically made of plastic, metal or aluminum. The panels are fastened on the exterior walls around entryways and windows, and they can be removed when hurricane seasons subside. Storm panels are cost-effective and offer basic protection. They cost $7 to $15 (CAD 9 to CAD 20) each, depending on the material you choose.

### Bahama

Bahama shutters attach to windows via top hinges that allow them to swing up to open and swing down to close via telescoping arms. These shutters are permanently installed and have a distinct style that boosts curb appeal.
