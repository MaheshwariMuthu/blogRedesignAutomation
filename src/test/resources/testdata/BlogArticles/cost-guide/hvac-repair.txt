But you may be able to avoid such malfunctions in the future with regular inspections and maintenance.

Here’s how much you can expect to pay for your HVAC repair or maintenance and what you can do to troubleshoot the system yourself.

How Much Do HVAC Repairs Cost?
------------------------------

According to [HomeGuide](https://homeguide.com/costs/ac-repair-cost), air conditioner repairs cost about $150 to $650 (CAD 195 to CAD 850) on average. If your furnace needs to be repaired, expect to pay between [$125 and $480](https://homeguide.com/costs/furnace-repair-service-cost) (CAD 160 and CAD 625).

However, there is usually more to the picture when it comes to HVAC repairs. You may need to pay more for additional parts and services.

Can I Do HVAC Repairs Myself?
-----------------------------

You're probably better off leaving HVAC repairs to the professionals. Maintenance and repair require a good deal of technical knowledge. Installing an HVAC system may also require a city permit.

That said, you may be able to troubleshoot minor problems before calling in a technician. Here are a few basic things to try:

*   If your HVAC unit isn't working, you may have experienced a simple power outage. If so, check the circuit breakers and flip them back to the right position if they're not already there.
*   If the breakers are in the correct position, switch them off for 10 seconds and then back on again to reset the system.
*   If your thermostat is battery-operated, check and change the batteries.

Past these basic steps, it's best to have your HVAC unit examined and serviced by a trained technician.

Labor Costs for HVAC Repair
---------------------------

According to [HomeGuide](https://homeguide.com/costs/hvac-repair-cost#hourly), HVAC technicians charge about $75 to $150 (CAD 100 to CAD 195) per hour for labor. There is typically a fee for the service call. The charge is $75 to $200 (CAD 100 to CAD 260) and is usually deducted from your final bill or assumed as the first hour of labor.

### Flat Rates and Emergency Services

Some HVAC repair companies offer a flat rate for smaller repair jobs. This can potentially save you money, as you’ll be protected from additional costs if a job turns out to be more labor-intensive than was initially expected.

The most expensive labor costs arise from emergency services and calls made after business hours. The price of emergency services varies depending on what’s wrong with your system.

You should expect to pay [$140 to $210](https://homeguide.com/costs/hvac-repair-cost#hourly) (CAD 180 to CAD 280) per hour for emergency services. Extensive emergency repairs may cost up to $600 (CAD 780) per hour. For after-hours or weekend calls, an HVAC technician may charge an additional $40 to $80 (CAD 50 to CAD 105) per hour.

HVAC Maintenance
----------------

Periodic maintenance and tune-ups can help your HVAC systems continue to run in tip-top shape. An HVAC technician can also provide these services.

* **Furnace tune-up:** [$80 to $110](https://www.costimates.com/costs/heating-air-conditioning/furnace-maintenance-tuneup/) (CAD 105 to CAD 140)
* **Complete system tune-up:** [$70 to $200](https://homeguide.com/costs/hvac-repair-cost#tune) (CAD 90 to CAD 260)
* **Annual service agreement with two tune-ups:** $150 to $300 (CAD 195 to CAD 390)

During a tune-up, the technician will clean your filter, blow out dust and repair any worn-out parts. Most HVAC companies offer an annual service agreement, which includes two annual tune-ups. The technician will also refill the AC unit's refrigerant and replace any damaged blades.

Parts and Repairs
-----------------

HVAC systems consist of multiple components. When they break or malfunction, those parts can be repaired or replaced individually. Here are a few common HVAC issues and how much they cost to repair, according to [HomeGuide](https://homeguide.com/costs/ac-repair-cost#breaker):

* **Faulty fuse or breaker:** $75 to $300 (CAD 100 to CAD 390)
* **Clogged air filter:** $200 to $300 (CAD 260 to CAD 390)

Installing a New HVAC Unit
--------------------------

Sometimes, an HVAC system can’t be fixed with replacement parts. You can expect a well-maintained HVAC unit to last 15 years or more, but it will need to be replaced eventually. The cost of installation will depend on whether you need new ductwork. It costs $2,000 to $9,000 (CAD 2,600 to CAD 11,750) to switch out your old AC unit with a new one, according to [Fixr](https://www.fixr.com/costs/air-conditioner-installation). A new furnace will cost between [$2,000 and $5,400](https://homeguide.com/costs/new-furnace-replacement-cost) (CAD 2,600 and CAD 7,000) on average.

Installing new ductwork typically adds between [$1,900 and $6,000](https://www.fixr.com/costs/ductwork#cost-of-ductwork-per-linear-foot-by-material) (CAD 2,500 and CAD 7,800) to the cost of a new HVAC unit. It costs [between $200 and $700](https://homeguide.com/costs/cost-to-replace-ductwork#repair) (CAD 260 and CAD 915) to repair existing ductwork.

Labor usually accounts for 40% to 50% of your total project cost, but other expenses may crop up, too. You may need to obtain a permit to install a new unit. In some cases, a concrete foundation must be poured for the new unit.
