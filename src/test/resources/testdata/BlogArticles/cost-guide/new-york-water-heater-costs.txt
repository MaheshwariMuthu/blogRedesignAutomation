  Real talk, New York. As much as we’d like to pretend the Big Apple is all hype, we love to romanticize your foldable pizzas, [bodega cats](https://hyperallergic.com/640916/new-york-bodega-cats-instagram-photography-rob-hitt/) and even your filthy streets. In what other city in the world could a rat skitter across your path, only for you to exclaim in awe: “_Only in New York!”_? However, locals know that living in NYC can be pretty expensive. Why would water heater service fees be any different? Actually, New Yorkers pay less to repair or replace their water heaters compared to the U.S. average. This includes you, too, Upstaters. The Empire State isn’t just the five boroughs, after all.

Your water heater powers your dishwasher, clothes washer and the hot shower you crave at the end of the day. When it goes kaput, it's not so much a matter of _whether_ you should have it serviced, but how much that service will cost. And if your hot water is already out, the last thing you want right now is to be blindsided by exorbitant water heater service fees. If you’re calling around for estimates, these figures should give you a ballpark idea of how much you can expect to pay in your state.

Repair and replacement costs vary depending on where you live. For comparison, the national average for diagnosis is $99, for repair is $493 and for replacement is $1,741.

The following average prices are based on aggregated HomeServe data reported by our network of contractors across New York:

Water Heater Diagnosis: $84
---------------------------

The diagnostic fee is what the technician will charge to come out to your home, inspect your system and tell you whether it needs to be repaired or replaced. In New York, this fee is about 15% lower than the national average.

Water Heater Repair: $310
-------------------------

Any of a number of things may be going wrong with your water heater — issues with the gas control valve, a faulty thermostat or a combination of several malfunctions. This average repair price includes replacement parts and the labor to install them. Repairs cost New Yorkers an average of 37% less than the U.S. overall.

Water Heater Replace: $1,521
----------------------------

If you’ve gotten 10 years out of your water heater, consider yourself lucky. That’s about the average lifespan of these machines. If yours is older than that, this breakdown might be a sign it has reached the end of its useful life, in which case, you’ll need to spring for a new one. New York’s average replacement price is about 13% less than the nation’s.

(Note that HomeServe water heater data should generally be assumed to refer to conventional “tanked” models — the most common type — as opposed to tankless or “on-demand” models, which can cost roughly twice as much.)
