When the belt breaks, you can be left with soggy wet laundry, a washing tub full of water and a headache trying to figure out what to do next.

What Happens to Your Washer When the Belt Breaks?
-------------------------------------------------

The belt on your washing machine is what allows the drum to spin and rotate during the wash cycles. The belt connects to the motor and the drum and uses the power from the motor to make the drum spin. When the belt breaks, there's a disconnect.

A belt can break suddenly, but it's more common for it to fray over time and then break. Signs of a problem with your washing machine belt include a smell of burnt rubber, squealing or thumping sounds and issues with your wash cycle. For example, you may notice that the machine stops mid-cycle or won't agitate. If your washer provides an error code, you can look it up to see if it indicates an issue with the belt.

How Much Does a New Belt Cost?
------------------------------

The cost of the washing machine belt depends on the make and model of your washer. Very high-end models are likely to be more expensive, and older models may be as well if the parts are no longer sold by the manufacturer and are in high demand on resell sites. The average cost for a washing machine belt is $5 to $30 (CAD 6.70 to CAD 41), according to [HomeGuide](https://homeguide.com/costs/washing-machine-repair-cost).

Can You Fix It Yourself?
------------------------

Washing machine belt repair is a quick and fairly easy job if you have the right tools and some general mechanical knowledge. Before attempting to fix the machine yourself, make sure the repair isn't covered under your warranty. If you still have an active warranty, making any DIY repairs can void it, so double-check your paperwork before getting started.

Start by disconnecting the power and water supply lines from the washing machine and pulling it out from the wall. The access panel for the belt is likely to be in the back of the machine, but some models have it in the front. Remove the panel and find the belt. This is also a good time to see if an item, such as a hair clip or sock, got stuck and broke the belt.

Pull the old belt off and attach the new one. The belt is designed for a perfect fit, and you'll need to stretch it gently to get it in place. It's important to make sure the belt is straight and centered on the pulleys to avoid fraying and another break down the line. Manually spin the washer drum to ensure everything is connected properly, and put the washer back together. Reattach the hoses and power supply, and run a cycle without clothes to test it.

How Much Does It Cost to Have a Washer Belt Repaired by a Pro?
--------------------------------------------------------------

If you aren't an experienced DIYer or you don't have time to do the repair, this may be a time when you need to call in a pro. Professional washing machine belt repair costs an average of $100 to $200 (CAD 134 to CAD 268), depending on the technician's labor charge.
