  Do you wish every day could be a spa day? Home saunas allow you to enjoy the benefits of a relaxing heat treatment without expensive spa memberships. However, they can also be relatively costly to build.

So, how much should you expect to spend recreating a spa experience in your own home? Let's explore what a home sauna costs with a detailed breakdown.

What Is a Home Sauna, and How Does It Work?
-------------------------------------------

[Home saunas](https://www.familyhandyman.com/article/what-to-know-about-home-saunas/) generate heat in an enclosed space and are common in various cultures worldwide. Some say spending time in a sauna helps improve circulation while promoting pain relief and relaxation.

There are two types of saunas: wet saunas and dry saunas. Wet saunas produce hot, humid air, while dry saunas create dry heat using a gas, wood-burning or electric heat source. Most home saunas are dry saunas and contain a heat source in a wooden structure.

How Much Does a Home Sauna Cost?
--------------------------------

According to [HomeGuide](https://homeguide.com/costs/sauna-cost#:~:text=The%20cost%20to%20build%20a%20dry%20sauna%20is%20%242%2C300%20to,saunas%20use%20only%20dry%20heat.), a home sauna costs $6,000 (CAD 8,158) on average. Most homeowners spend between $3,000 and $10,000 (CAD 4,079 and CAD 13,596), but you could spend tens of thousands on a custom sauna room.

How much it costs to install a sauna depends on its type and quality. Portable or tent saunas cost between $200 and $2,600 (CAD 272). These saunas are easy to transport and take up relatively little floor space. However, most models are only suitable for one person and are less powerful than permanent options.

Prefabricated home saunas are decent mid-range options and are relatively simple to construct. These saunas come in kits containing everything you need to build and run the unit. Most cost between $5,500 and $15,500 (CAD 7,478 and CAD 21,074) professionally installed.

You could consider purchasing a custom home sauna if you have a higher budget. Custom home saunas allow you to personalize the design to your unique specifications, but they're also expensive. Custom-built saunas start from around $8,000 (CAD 10,877), including materials and labor. Larger custom saunas containing premium features and materials can cost up to $34,000 (CAD 46,228) or more.

### Heating System

The heating system included in your home sauna can also impact the price. Infrared sauna heaters are the cheapest option at $200 to $600 (CAD 272 to CAD 816), while electric heaters cost around $700 to $3,800 (CAD 952 to CAD 5,167).

Most homeowners spend around $800 to $3,000 (CAD 1,088 to CAD 4,079) for a wood-burning heater or $800 to $4,600 (CAD 1,088 to CAD 6,254) for a gas heater.

### Home Sauna Size

The larger your home sauna, the more you'll pay. Small saunas measuring around 12 to 15 square feet are suitable for one person and usually cost $1,500 to $4,600 (CAD 2,039 to CAD 6,254). Meanwhile, a two-person sauna costs between $2,800 and $7,700 (CAD 3,807 and CAD 10,469).

### Material

The wood type used to build your home sauna affects how much you'll pay for materials. Basswood is typically the cheapest option at $1 to $3 (CAD 1.36 to CAD 4) per square foot. Pine and redwood come in at a similar price point. For red cedar, you’ll pay between $2 to $15 (CAD 2.72 to CAD 20) per square foot.

### Labor

Most homeowners pay contractors between $300 and $2,500 (CAD 408 to CAD 3,399) in labor fees to construct a home sauna. However, you could pay more for a complex structure or in an area with high living costs.

You may need a dedicated circuit if you install an electric home sauna. Most electricians charge between $250 and $900 (CAD 340 to CAD 1,224) for this service.
