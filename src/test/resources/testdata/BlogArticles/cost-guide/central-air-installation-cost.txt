Imagine every room of your house set at a comfortable, even temperature. Central air systems are generally preferred over AC units because they are more efficient at providing better cooling, and they are also great at filtering air. This is especially important if you have allergies or asthma. Unfortunately, some places aren't set up to accommodate a central air unit, but if you have the capability and can afford the cost, installation should be at the top of your checklist.

## How Much Does Having Central Air Cost?
If you are considering a central air system, then you may be wondering how much it costs. The cost to install central air ranges from $5,000 to $8,000, depending on the system and size of your home. If your home needs new ductwork installed, that is an additional cost to consider. The cost for a central air unit with ductwork would be on the higher end of the price spectrum, even upward of $15,000. There could be a lot of fluctuation in the [actual cost of installing a central air unit system](/en-us/blog/cost-guide/air-conditioner-installation-cost){target="_blank"} due to all of the underlying factors involved.

Although there can be a significant cost involved with a central air system, it is one of the best options for consistent cooling in the home. A general contractor must first assess the house to give you an accurate cost. More on that later.

## DIY vs Professional
Although there are many homeownership projects that you can do it yourself, there are times when you should hire a professional to do the job. Installing a central air system is a perfect example of when you should hire a professional. Here are a few reasons why you should hire a certified HVAC professional to install and maintain your new central air system.

## Skip the Manual Labor
Installing a central air system has a lot of manual labor involved. You may find yourself crawling underneath your house, lifting heavy objects, climbing onto the roof, pouring down a concrete base, and performing any number of other strenuous activities. Hiring a professional will allow the job to be performed correctly, by a professional, and allow you to sit back and wait for your new central air system to be installed.

Sometimes, your contractor has the ability to negotiate a lower rate for the central air unit due to their relationship with the manufacturer and using a certain brand. It is important to know that you will still pay labor costs for the unit's installation, which can also be expensive. You may also need to finance the work related to preparation for installation. This type of work could include pouring a concrete slab or making modifications in order to accommodate the system on your roof. However, a professional will be able to oversee these details for you.

## No Legwork Involved
Many times, local government regulations require permits for home improvement projects, including central air unit systems. The professionals know the permits to apply for, and they do all the paperwork themselves, so you don't have to worry about going down to your local township hall to figure it all out. This can also help with timelines and getting things done quickly.

## Maintenance Plans
When you hire a professional, you often have the ability to opt in for a [maintenance plan](/en-us/repair-plans/hvac/cooling-system/){target="_blank"} to keep your unit in top shape. The professional you hire has established familiarity with the unit and your home and can easily come and check out things whenever you request it.

## Tips for Hiring a Professional
No matter whom you decide to hire, you want to make sure that they are reputable, licensed, and insured. You need to make sure that the person has the ability to do the work and can stand by their work if there are any issues.

Don't just settle for the first person you find. It pays to obtain at least three estimates from contractors in your area. Price isn't always the determining factor, however. It's always good to ask for referrals or look at online reviews if there are any.
