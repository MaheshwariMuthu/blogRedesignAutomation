### Material

Some shutter materials are more affordable than others. If you're on a tight budget, you can purchase affordable vinyl or faux wood shutters for around $100 to $300 (CAD 136 to CAD 408) per pair. Synthetic foam shutters, solid wood and aluminum options are midrange in terms of price. MDF is the most expensive shutter material at $300 to $700 (CAD 408 to CAD 953) per pair.

### Opening Mechanism

Manual shutters typically cost $300 to $700 (CAD 408 to CAD 953) per pair, while motorized models could cost almost twice as much.
