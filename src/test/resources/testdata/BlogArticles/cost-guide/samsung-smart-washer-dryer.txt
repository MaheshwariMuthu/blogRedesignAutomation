Samsung is one of the most well-known companies producing smart washers and dryers. Here’s how much it’ll cost to add one of their products to your laundry room — and what you get for the price.

How Much Does a Samsung Smart Washer Cost?
------------------------------------------

[Samsung smart washers cost](https://www.samsung.com/us/home-appliances/washers/all-washers/?key_features=Wi-Fi+Connectivity) between $949 and $1,599﻿ (CAD 1,259 and CAD 2,122). Prices for each model vary depending on the load capacity and special features. The cheapest model in Samsung's smart washer range has a 4.5-cubic-foot capacity, and the most expensive holds up to 6 cubic feet.

How Much Does a Samsung Smart Dryer Cost?
-----------------------------------------

[Samsung smart dryers cost](https://www.samsung.com/us/home-appliances/dryers/all-dryers/?shop=Buy+Online&key_features=Wi-Fi+Connectivity) between $1,249 and $1,599 (CAD 1,657 and CAD 2,122). Each dryer has a 7.4- or 7.5-cubic-foot capacity, and you can choose between electric and gas models. All models feature a steam function to sanitize and deodorize clothes and help reduce the amount of time spent on ironing. Models toward the higher end of the price range come with Samsung's FlexDry feature that lets you dry delicates and regular items together.

What's Included in the Cost of Samsung Smart Washers and Dryers?
----------------------------------------------------------------

The price of a Samsung smart washer or dryer includes the unit itself and shipping costs. You can also return your appliance free of charge within 15 days of purchase. All Samsung appliances come with a 1-year warranty for parts and labor and either a 3- or 5-year extended warranty, depending on the model.

However, the price doesn't cover installation. Samsung can [install your appliance](https://www.samsung.com/us/home-appliances/washers/bespoke/bespoke-5-3-cu-ft-ultra-capacity-front-load-washer-with-ai-optiwash-and-auto-dispense-in-brushed-navy-wf53bb8900adus/) for you for a flat fee of $24.96 (CAD 33). Bear in mind that you may also need to hire a plumber or an electrician if you don't have the correct setup to support your new washer or dryer, so it's worth checking the installation checklist before buying. The company charges an additional $15 (CAD 20) to remove and dispose of your existing washer or dryer.

How Are Smart Washers and Dryers Different Than Regular Models?
---------------------------------------------------------------

Smart washers and dryers can connect to your home’s Wi-Fi. This function lets you control the appliance remotely from your smartphone or another handheld device using an app. The primary advantage of a smart washer or dryer is that you can start or stop cycles when you're away from your home and receive updates when the cycle finishes. Many smart appliances come with extra features — such as remote troubleshooting — depending on which brand and model you purchase.

You can control your Samsung smart washer or dryer using the manufacturer’s Smart Care app. This app helps you remotely schedule cycles and start and stop the machine, and it provides cycle suggestions for the best settings for your laundry load. If your machine malfunctions, you can perform diagnostic tests from the app and access troubleshooting solutions to help you get your appliance up and running again.
