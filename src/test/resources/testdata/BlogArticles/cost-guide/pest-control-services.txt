  Bugs. While they're a part of nature, flying, crawling and slithering pests don't belong inside your home. Perhaps you’ve noticed a colony of ants in your kitchen or a bunch of bees building a hive too close for comfort.

You might be wondering how much it would cost to get rid of them. Additionally, you may consider tackling the problem yourself. But before you head to the local home improvement store to load up on bug spray and rodent traps, take a look at how much pest control services cost.

How Much Is Pest Control for a House?
-------------------------------------

There's no set price for how much it costs for a professional pest control service. Insects and rodents come in all shapes and sizes and require different techniques to rid them from your house. Another factor is the house size. It takes more time, work and pesticide to remove and prevent bugs and rodents in a 2,500-square-foot home compared to a 1,500-square-foot house.

The cost of extermination services varies by pest type. For example, ants can range from a one-time fee of $100 to $500 (CAD 133 to CAD 664), depending on the type of ant and complexity of the job, according to [This Old House](https://www.thisoldhouse.com/pest-control/reviews/pest-control-cost). What's the most expensive insect to eradicate from your home? Believe it or not, bed bugs top the list. A one-time payment of up to $5,000 (CAD 6,641) may be in order for professional removal of these pests.

To keep pests at bay, you may opt for regular treatments. [This Old House](https://www.thisoldhouse.com/pest-control/reviews/pest-control-cost) says you’ll pay between $40 and $70 (CAD 53 and CAD 93) each visit for monthly or bi-monthly services. For quarterly services, expect to pay $100 to $300 (CAD 133 to CAD 398) per visit.

Is It Better to Hire Pest Control or Do It Yourself?
----------------------------------------------------

It depends on the situation. A few ants in the kitchen are easier to handle than a carpenter ant infestation. Additionally, safety might be a concern when you're dealing with bugs such as wasps.

Consider the advantages of an exterminator. A flea outbreak in a home with multiple pets can take months to get under control. In addition, mice and rats can be dangerous. They chew wires, drop feces everywhere and carry disease. While you might be okay with removing one or two with traps, if you have more than a couple, it's time to hire a professional to eliminate your rodent problem.

And even if you don't normally have a pest-control issue, if you live somewhere in cicada territory, you may find yourself dealing with annoying pests periodically.

One pest service you can do yourself is prevention. Once the insects or rodents are gone, it's time to work on a plan to keep them out. The bug control professional may offer tips to prevent re-entries, such as caulking the gaps between your home's trim and siding or installing a dehumidifier in the basement to reduce spiders.

What Does the Average Cost of Pest Control Include?
---------------------------------------------------

It's common to want to know what you're getting for the price you pay. Most services include a 30-day guarantee depending on the pest type. Some companies offer expanded guarantees for 60 to 90 days for customers that buy certain upgrade services.

Another advantage of an exterminator comes with rodent problems. Clearing your home of rats and mice is a multi-step process. First, you need to locate and take out the pests, clean the urine and feces and close up the holes they're using to get into your home. The [$200 to $600](https://www.thisoldhouse.com/pest-control/reviews/mice-exterminator-cost) (CAD 266 to CAD 797) cost of professional pest control includes removing live and dead rodents, treating the area and closing up potential entrances. However, if you have a large infestation, it can cost you $1,000 (CAD 1,328) or more.

Are Pest Control Services Worth the Money?
------------------------------------------

For people without experience handling pesticides or who have no knowledge of how to stop and prevent different insects, professional pest control may be more than worth the money. For some pests, it might even be necessary. Your homeowner's insurance policy may require a professional for termite treatment, for example. In addition to removing termites, companies often offer an annual inspection to assure you the problem is resolved. Although some businesses offer this service at no cost, it can run you up to $400 (CAD 531), according to data from [Bob Vila](https://www.bobvila.com/articles/termite-inspection-cost/).

Another time you'll need to hire a pest control service is when you're going to sell your home. Completing this task before starting the process of putting your house on the market can save you money and embarrassment. Many potential sellers have found out the hard way they have critters in their crawlspace. You don't want to add "family of squirrels" to the listing. Instead, hire a pest control service to check for these issues first.
