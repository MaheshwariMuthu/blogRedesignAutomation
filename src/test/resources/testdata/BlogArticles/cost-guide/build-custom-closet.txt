Creating extra storage space is a great way to reduce clutter inside your home, but freestanding units can take up a significant amount of floor space. Custom closets are an excellent alternative if you're someone who likes a designated spot for all your belongings.

According to data from [Fixr](https://www.fixr.com/costs/custom-closet-installation#enhancement-and-improvement-costs), the average homeowner spends around $3,500 (CAD 4,500) on a custom closet, but the costs can vary significantly.

Custom Walk-In Closet: Average Cost
-----------------------------------

On average, a custom walk-in closet costs between [$2,500 and $5,000](https://www.fixr.com/costs/custom-closet-installation#enhancement-and-improvement-costs) (CAD 3,200 and CAD 6,400). You can reduce the cost of your walk-in closet by choosing affordable materials, such as pine, and limiting the size. Meanwhile, expect to pay toward the higher end of the scale for a large walk-in closet made from premium materials with multiple add-ons.

Custom Closets Cost Per Square Foot
-----------------------------------

Contractors generally charge between $17 and $30 (CAD 23 and CAD 40) to build a custom closet, according to data from [Angi](https://www.fixr.com/costs/custom-closet-installation#enhancement-and-improvement-costs). This price usually includes labor, materials and any other equipment required to complete the project. However, some contractors charge an hourly labor rate and add an extra charge per square foot for materials.

What Factors Affect How Much a Custom Closet Costs?
---------------------------------------------------

Various factors can affect how much a custom closet costs. Understanding how factors, such as the design, layout and materials, can impact the overall price can help you choose an option to suit your budget.

### Type of Custom Closet

Custom walk-in closets are usually the most expensive, but there are plenty of [cheaper options](https://www.fixr.com/costs/custom-closet-installation#enhancement-and-improvement-costs). Installing a reach-in custom closet is usually the most affordable choice, costing between $500 and $1,500. Built-in closets usually cost between $1,000 and $2,500. However, constructing a built-in closet could be significantly more expensive if you need to carry out renovations to create a suitable space.

Having a contractor build a custom freestanding wardrobe usually costs between $1,000 and $3,000. A freestanding wardrobe is often more affordable if you don't have an existing space to build a reach-in or built-in model. Contractors can add features, such as shelves and rails, to provide the convenience of a custom closet without the costly renovations.

Wall-mount designs are [typically cheaper](https://www.homedepot.com/services/c/cost-install-custom-closet/22ef3e97b) than floor-mount styles.
