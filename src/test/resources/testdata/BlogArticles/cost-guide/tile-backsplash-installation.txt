Various factors can affect how much backsplash installation costs, including the type of material and whether you need to remove an old backsplash first. This guide should help you estimate how much you'll pay for your kitchen upgrade. 

Backsplash Installation Average Cost
------------------------------------

According to data from [Fixr](https://www.fixr.com/costs/backsplash-installation), most homeowners pay around $1,500 (CAD 1,900) in total for backsplash installation, with a typical range between $900 and $2,500 (CAD 1,200 and CAD 3,200). 

Backsplash Installation Cost by Material
----------------------------------------

You can use almost any waterproof material as a backsplash, but you may need to stainproof them first, which could add to the overall cost. The following materials are popular choices for backsplashes:

### Ceramic Tile

Ceramic tile is easy to care for and clean. It also comes in a range of patterns and finishes, making it a popular material for backsplashes. Installing a ceramic tile backsplash costs between [$200 and $3,300](https://www.fixr.com/costs/backsplash-installation#ceramic-tile-backsplash-cost) (CAD 260 and CAD 4,300), depending on the color, quality and style.

### Porcelain Tile

Porcelain tile is a resilient material that resists scratching and cracking. However, it isn't as commonly used as ceramic for backsplashes because there aren't as many finishing options available. Expect to pay between [$300 and $1,200](https://www.fixr.com/costs/backsplash-installation#porcelain-tile-backsplash-cost) (CAD 390 and CAD 1,600) to have a porcelain tile backsplash installed. 

### Marble

Marble is a durable material, but you'll need to treat it to help it resist stains. The cost to install a marble backsplash varies significantly depending on whether you use tiles or a solid slab. Backsplash installation costs range from around $390 (CAD 510) if you use tiles, to $6,000 (CAD 7,800) if you use a solid slab.

### Granite

Like marble, the cost of a granite backsplash depends on whether you use tiles or a single slab. Installing a granite tile backsplash costs around $600 (CAD 780), rising to roughly $7,500 (CAD 9,800) for a slab.

### Glass

Installing a glass tile backsplash costs between $640 and $1,300 (CAD 830 and CAD 1,700) installed, according to data from [HomeGuide](https://homeguide.com/costs/tile-installation-cost). Glass tiles are relatively cheap, but they're fiddly and time-consuming to install. Expect to pay toward the higher end of the scale if you want bespoke or handmade tiles. 

### Metal

Stainless steel and aluminum backsplash are popular options in contemporary kitchens, but you shouldn't place aluminum in a hot area like behind a stove. Both options cost between [$900 and $2,250](https://www.fixr.com/costs/backsplash-installation#stainless-steel-backsplash-cost) (CAD 1,175 and CAD 2,900) for materials and installation.

How Much Does Backsplash Installation Labor Cost?
-------------------------------------------------

How much you pay for labor depends on the size of your backsplash and how difficult the material is to install. [Fixr](https://www.fixr.com/costs/backsplash-installation) says installation labor costs around $10 (CAD 13) per square foot. However, you could pay as little as $5 (CAD 6) per square foot for a ceramic tile backsplash or as much as $30 (CAD 40) for a solid stone slab.

How Much Does It Cost to Remove an Existing Backsplash?
-------------------------------------------------------

It usually costs between $1 and $3 (CAD 1 to CAD 4) per square foot to remove an old tile backsplash before installing a new one. However, you may need to install new drywall if removing the backsplash damages the wall underneath. Budget around $3 (CAD 4) extra per square foot if you require new drywall.
