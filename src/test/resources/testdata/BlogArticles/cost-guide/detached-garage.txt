  For homebuyers with multiple cars, secure garage space is a huge selling point. In addition to vehicles, garages also store those “outdoor” items that would be awkward to stash in the house: sports gear, power tools and lawn equipment. The upfront cost of adding a detached garage to your property can be steep, but the boost to your property value — and the added convenience — may be worth it.

Adding a garage to your property could be a great investment — but it’s also an expensive undertaking. To help you plan your project more effectively, here’s a cost breakdown.

Benefits of a Detached Garage
-----------------------------

Building a detached garage is easier than building an attached garage because you have more freedom over its location. Depending on your property's size and layout, this could help you avoid issues with utility lines, planning permissions or areas that are difficult to work with.

You also have some freedom of choice when it comes to the materials and style of the building. Generally, an attached garage matches the style of the home it is stuck to, but a detached garage can be complementary instead of identical. If you're on a budget, you can choose more cost-effective materials — such as vinyl siding — and not have to worry about the building being an exact match to the rest of your structures.

Detached Garage Costs
---------------------

Construction costs can vary dramatically depending on the type of garage you want. One-car garages or prefab models can cost as little as a few thousand dollars. According to [Fixr](https://www.fixr.com/costs/build-detached-garage), the average cost to build a detached garage is between $30,000 and $60,000 (CAD 38,500 and CAD 77,000). The cost varies depending on the design and materials used. Three- and four-car garages or garages for RVs could cost well above $45,000 (CAD 57,800).

A significant portion of this cost is labor, but the materials you choose will also have a bearing on the overall project price. To more accurately calculate what it would cost to build a detached garage, start by working out the garage's size. Look at plans and prices for similar projects.

Here are several factors to consider:

### Size

A two- or three-car garage will obviously cost more than a one-car garage, but the exact dimensions matter, too. For example, a 30-foot by 40-foot garage will cost more to build than a 30-foot by 30-foot garage.

### Location

If the area is hilly or uneven, it will need to be leveled. The cost to prepare the site may be higher.

### Materials

Vinyl siding will cost less than wood or metal siding, and asphalt shingles will cost less than metal roofing.

### Features

Adding heat or air conditioning in the garage will drive up the cost, as will adding storage solutions like shelving. Depending on the type, a garage-door opener may also bump up the price.

### Labor Costs

If you’re using contractors for some (or all) of the project, that will increase costs as well.

Detached Garage Cost by Size
----------------------------

The square footage has a big influence on the total cost of the garage. A one-door, single-car garage could be as small as 10 feet by 16 feet, but this would leave very little space for storage and may not accommodate a large vehicle.

A traditional one-car garage is 12 feet by 20 feet. This will allow you to store bikes, gardening equipment, boxes and other items alongside your car. The average cost is between $22,000 and $32,000 (CAD 28,300 and CAD 41,100). If you choose low-cost materials, you could build one for even less.

For a two-car garage, expect to pay between $31,000 and $39,000 (CAD 39,800 and CAD 50,100). If you're looking to add more space, you could build a two-story garage and convert the top level into a small living or storage area. This addition would tack about $100 (CAD 130) per square foot onto the price, according to [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/home-improvement/cost-to-build-garage/).

These prices include the materials and labor. You can reduce the bill by shopping around for materials. If you have the right skills, you may be able to do a portion of the work yourself.

Other Factors to Consider
-------------------------

There are several side costs associated with building a detached garage, like having a new section of driveway installed, laying a proper foundation and installing security for the garage. A quality concrete foundation helps protect the garage's structure, reducing the risk of settling, cracks and other problems.<br><iframe title="YouTube video player" width="1072" height="603" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/reJaChMAC_w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
