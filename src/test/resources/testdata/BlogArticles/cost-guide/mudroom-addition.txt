  Mudrooms are popular with homeowners who live in areas that see a lot of rainy or snowy weather. These rooms serve as a buffer between the out-of-doors and your house, giving your family a space to remove their muddy shoes, wet raincoats or snow gear and for pets to shake out their fur before going inside.

That all sounds well and good, but how much does a mudroom addition cost? And is it worth the expense? Here’s what you need to know.

What Would an Average-Sized Mudroom Addition Cost?
--------------------------------------------------

The cost of a mudroom addition depends on the size of the room and whether you're converting an existing porch or other space or building the mudroom from scratch.

Building a mudroom addition costs between $100 and $200 (CAD 130 and CAD 260) per square foot for a small addition or conversion, according to pricing data from [Fixr](https://www.fixr.com/costs/mudroom-addition). Larger additions cost somewhat more—around $100 and $300 (CAD 130 and CAD 390) per square foot.

Overall, most homeowners spend between $12,000 and $18,000 (CAD 16,000 and CAD 24,000) on a mudroom addition. This cost includes the construction of an addition, installing flooring, painting, adding storage, constructing a built-in bench and putting in a washing area.

Does a Mudroom Add Value?
-------------------------

A mudroom addition could make your property more appealing to prospective buyers, depending on the size of the room and the general features. Mudrooms serve as a practical space for hanging coats, storing sports gear and changing out of dirty clothes after outdoor activities.

Adding a mudroom can free up space in other areas, so you can use your basement more creatively or turn your shed into an outdoor office. Even a small mudroom can add a lot of storage space. If you have hardwood floors or plush carpets in the rest of your house, adding a mudroom makes it easier to keep your living space clean, which will protect your investment in other areas of your home.

Does a Mudroom Need a Foundation?
---------------------------------

No matter how large or small your mudroom dimensions, your mudroom will be an addition to the building. This means you'll need to work within building codes, which include adding a foundation for the mudroom. Most foundations are concrete footings set about 4 feet into the ground. This is what you'll need when building a mudroom, so you’ll have to factor that cost into the build. Mudroom additions are a great investment, but they're hardly a budget home improvement project.

What Goes Into a Good Mudroom?
------------------------------

Depending on the size of the mudroom and its layout, you can add a lot of creative storage solutions, a changing area, sinks or laundry machines.

Your mudroom remodel should reflect your lifestyle. For example, if you regularly go hiking and come home muddy, a washing bench makes sense. If you're more worried about trekking in lots of snow or dripping water, you might want to save a few square feet on a washing area and just have benches and an area to hang all those wet clothes.
