If you're looking for a way to make your bathroom feel a bit more luxurious without shelling out for a full remodel, fitting a new shower is a great option.

The cost to remodel your shower depends on what fixtures and fittings are already in the bathroom. Installing a shower where there wasn’t one previously will add to the overall price. The cost will also vary based on the size of the shower and its features. Remodeling costs don't just include the shower unit itself; you may also need to install tile around the shower or upgrade the plumbing in the bathroom.

Shower Remodel Cost Estimates
-----------------------------

According to [HomeGuide](https://homeguide.com/costs/bathroom-remodel-cost#breakdown), the average cost to remodel a shower is between $800 and $5,000 (CAD 1,000 and CAD 6,300), but you may be able to find basic installations for around $500 (CAD 630). A walk-in shower will cost more than a standard tub-shower combo because of the added complexity of the job.

What Factors Influence Remodeling Costs?
----------------------------------------

The biggest factor that will determine the cost of the remodel is what type of shower you choose. These are some common options:

*   Shower in a half bath
*   Tub-shower combos
*   Shower stalls
*   Walk-in showers
*   Wet rooms

If you're remodeling the shower in your master bedroom, consider a tub-shower combo. The presence of a bathtub in a master bathroom can greatly increase the resale value of your home. Tub-shower combos are slightly more expensive than other types because you will have to pay for the bathtub, surround and installation.

Walk-in showers and wet rooms are the most expensive option due to the amount of tiling and waterproofing work required. [Wet rooms](https://www.homeserve.com/en-us/blog/how-to/build-wet-room/) require a full bathroom remodel. While a simple shower installation could be a DIY project (for those confident in their skills), you will probably want to have a professional install a walk-in shower or wet room. According to [Fixr](https://www.fixr.com/costs/bathroom-remodeling), a wet room remodel can cost as much as $25,000 (CAD 31,500).

For a standard rectangular stall shower, expect to pay between $525 and $10,000 (CAD 660 and CAD 12,600). On the lower end of that range, you can install a basic walk-in shower. Budget toward the upper end if you prefer more luxurious tiles and fixtures.

How to Save Money on Your Shower Remodel
----------------------------------------

If you already have a bathtub and simply want to fit a shower to it, expect to pay between [$300 and $2,000](https://www.fixr.com/costs/install-shower-stall#adding-a-shower-to-a-half-bath-cost) (CAD 380 and CAD 2,500). However, if you go this route, you may also need to pay to have the area around the shower tiled to prevent water damage.

Depending on the condition of your current bathroom, you may be able to achieve a fresh look by replacing your current fixtures and fittings and doing some basic DIY. You could get a new showerhead for as little as $20 (CAD 25), or a new shower door for between $100 and $1,400 (CAD 125 and CAD 1,770).
