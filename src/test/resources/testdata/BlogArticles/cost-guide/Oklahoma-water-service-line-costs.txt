Oklahoma homeowners, your state’s prized eastern redbud trees may [pose a low risk](https://sewerdrainrepair.com/blog/how-to-prevent-pipe-damage-from-tree-roots/) to your underground [water service line](https://www.homeserve.com/en-us/blog/home-improvement/exterior-water-service-lines-explained/) — but frequently freezing winter temperatures are certainly no pals to your pipes. So, if you find yourself standing in still water … but your house is nowhere near [_Stillwater_](http://stillwater.org), your water line may have suffered some damage during that last cold snap and is now leaking into your yard. You’ll need to act quick, Sooner State residents — but rest easy knowing that, compared with what the average American pays, your bill for water service line repair or replacement should be like your postal abbreviation: OK.

Your exterior water service line carries water from the public water main into your home. But make no mistake: Once the pipes run under your property, they’re _your_ responsibility — so you’re likely on the hook for any repair or replacement costs.

How deep your pipes are buried deeply impacts the price you pay for these services. Water service lines are buried as deep as local building codes require — but usually, the depth is determined by the frost line in your area. And the deeper the technician must dig to get to your broken or otherwise compromised line, the higher the cost.

The nationwide average water service line depth is 4.58 feet. In Oklahoma, these lines are buried more than a foot and a half shallower than that, at 2.9 feet on average. For context, in _f-f-f-freezing_ Minnesota, pipe depth is more than _8_ feet.

Repair and replacement costs also vary depending on where you live. The national average for diagnosis is $222, for repair is $1,039 and for replacement is $3,581.

Below, you’ll find average service prices based on aggregated HomeServe data reported by our network of contractors across Oklahoma, which should give you an approximation of how much you’ll pay to fix your out-of-commission water service line.

Water Service Line Diagnosis: $138
----------------------------------

Before any work can begin, the technician will need to come out and run some tests to see what’s wrong with your system. In Oklahoma, the fee for this is 38% less than the national average.

Water Service Line Repair: $973
-------------------------------

A whole host of things can cause trouble with your exterior water service line — from invading tree roots to clogs to general wear and tear. Whatever’s up with your system, the repair process will likely start with excavation to expose the pipe. Depending on your situation, the technician may need to clear a blockage, find a leak or fix the pipe — and, of course, fill the hole back in.

Oklahoma’s average repair price is about 6% lower than the nation’s.

Water Service Line Replace: $2,568
----------------------------------

Small sections of leaky or broken pipe can be repaired, but massive clogs or fully compromised pipes might necessitate a full replacement. Due in part to how deep your pipes are buried, water service line replacements cost  Okies about 28% less than the average American.
