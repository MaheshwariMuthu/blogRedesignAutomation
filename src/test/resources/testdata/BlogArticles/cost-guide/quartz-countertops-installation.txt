  **Quartz Countertop Installation Costs at a Glance**

* **Average total cost:** $2,000-$3,900 (CAD 2,600-CAD 5,100)
* **Material costs:** $30-$150+ (CAD 40-CAD 195+) per square foot
* **Labor costs:** $35-$85 (CAD 45-CAD 110) per hour
* **Compare to granite:** $40-$100 (CAD 50-CAD 130) per square foot

Quartz countertops are made of manufactured composite, which is a mixture of ground quartz, synthetic resins and colorants. They are cheap to maintain because they’re homogenous and nonporous. They also come in a variety of different colors and designs, customizable to your liking.

Quartz counters are a great option when improving your home because they're both beautiful and durable. If you're considering quartz, read on to learn more about pricing.

Quartz Countertops: Project Costs
---------------------------------

### Material Costs

The total cost of installing quartz countertops will vary depending on the type of quartz you select and the size of the counter.

For materials, quartz costs between $50 and $70 (CAD 65 and CAD 90) per square foot on average, based on data from [HomeGuide](https://homeguide.com/costs/quartz-countertops-cost). Prices can range from $30 to $150 (CAD 40 to CAD 195) or more per square foot, depending on the type of quartz you choose.

### Labor Costs

Some contractors charge by the hour. [Bob Vila](https://www.bobvila.com/articles/quartz-countertops-cost/) says you should expect to pay between $35 and $85 (CAD 45 and CAD 110) per hour in labor costs.

Otherwise, labor will cost between $10 and $30 (CAD 13 and CAD 40) per square foot. You’ll also have to pay for the quartz to be delivered, which costs $150 to $200 (CAD 195 to CAD 260), and removal of your current countertop, which costs $300 to $450. Additional work — like making fixture cut-outs, installing sinks or edging — will also add to the total price.

### Total Cost

Start to finish, expect to pay between $2,000 to $3,900 (CAD 2,600 to CAD 5,100) to have a quartz countertop installed.

Quartz Countertop Edge Treatments
---------------------------------

You can have the edges of your quartz countertop custom cut. Here are some of the basic ways your contractor can finish out your countertop's ends and corners:

* **Ogee:** S-shaped cuts with sharp corners
* **Bevel:** Straight, angular 45-degree cuts against the edge
* **Waterfall:** Flows over the edge of the counter down to the floor
* **Bullnose:** Rounded and smooth corners
* **Eased:** Straight edge

Quartz Countertop Finishes
--------------------------

You can also customize the finish of your quartz countertop. Here are some common textures:

### Polished

This is a smooth surface with a glossy finish that reflects light. A polished finish highlights the pattern and color of the quartz. It’s also durable and long-lasting.

### Honed

Honed quartz has less of a shine and looks more natural. This finish is more porous and requires extra maintenance.

### Concrete

It's a lightly textured surface that appears grainy. It can be expensive to maintain because it's porous.

### Rough

Rough quartz feels bumpy or coarse to the touch. This surface is the most porous.

Quartz or Granite?
------------------

Granite countertops offer a similar finish to quartz countertops for a similar price. Installed, granite countertops cost $40 to $100 (CAD 50 to CAD 130) per square foot — based on data from [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/home-improvement/granite-countertops-cost/) — depending on the grade of granite you choose.

Quartz countertops are more stain- and heat-resistant than granite. They’re also nonporous, where granite needs to be sealed. Quartz countertops are made of 95% natural quartz and 5% polymer resin. Because they’re manufactured, you can get them in almost any color.

Quartz is becoming more popular than granite because of its:

*   Chemical resistance
*   Impact resistance
*   Flexural strength
*   Fire resistance

What’s the Difference Between Quartz and Quartzite?
---------------------------------------------------

Quartzite is a natural stone. This is why quartzite is generally much more expensive than quartz, which is factory-made. Quartzite is also more durable than quartz. It’s less likely to scratch and can handle heat well. Because the natural stone is porous, you will have to apply sealer to quartzite at least once a year.

Pros and Cons of Quartz Countertops
-----------------------------------

If you’re thinking about installing quartz counters in your kitchen or bathroom, these are some of the advantages and disadvantages to consider:

### Pros

#### Antibacterial

Because it’s nonporous, quartz has antibacterial properties. There’s little risk of mold or bacterial growth, even in high-moisture areas.

#### Customizable

Unlike natural counters, manufactured quartz products are customizable. You can contact the manufacturer and ask them to make quartz counters in a color and style that fits your home. This also ensures your countertops will match your space. When buying natural stones, what you see on the website or in a showroom may differ from what you actually get because no two stones are the same.

#### Low Maintenance Cost

Quartz products are cheap to maintain because they’re nonporous. Unlike natural stones, they won’t need to be sealed or waxed.

#### Scratch and Stain Resistant

Scratches and stains are unavoidable in high-traffic kitchens and bathrooms. Quartz countertops aren’t as soft as some natural stones, making them resistant to scuffs, chips and stains.

#### Increased Home Value

A kitchen upgrade can make your property stand out among prospective buyers and boost its value. When selling your property, installing quartz counters can increase its value and make it attractive to potential buyers.

### Cons

#### Weather and Heat Resistance

Quartz counters cannot tolerate rapid temperature changes. You’ll have to use trivets or potholders to protect the surface from hot pans. If exposed to high heat, the resin can melt. In addition, they are only suitable for indoor use because they cannot withstand prolonged exposure to the sun.

#### Heavy

Quartz countertops may be too heavy for some cabinets to hold up. If your cabinets are not strong enough, you may have to reinforce them, which will increase the total installation cost.
