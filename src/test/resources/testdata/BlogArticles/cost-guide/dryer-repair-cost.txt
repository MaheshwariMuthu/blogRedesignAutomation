  Dealing with a broken dryer is never fun. As life will have it, you typically find out there's a problem with your dryer right after you’ve done a load in the washer and have soaking wet clothes. The end result is you finding places all over the house where you can hang your soggy jeans.

If you are having dryer issues, just know you don't have to suffer through months of clotheslining damp clothing while you save up for repairs. This cost guide should help you budget for dryer repairs and get back to warm, dry clothes.

**What’s Wrong With My Dryer?**
-------------------------------

The first step in figuring out the cost of repairs for your dryer is determining what the problem is in the first place. Dryers are actually fairly complicated appliances, and one little issue could be enough to cause bigger issues. In some cases, getting it running again might just require $10 (CAD 13) in parts, but in other cases, repairs can be so pricey that you are better off buying a brand-new dryer.

To identify the problem, you’ll have to take a look at what is going wrong. If your dryer will not turn on at all, the issue may be electrical. When a dryer is not spinning, you may have a malfunctioning motor, belt or capacitor. If your dryer runs but does not dry the clothes, there could be a problem with the thermal fuse or heating element.

**Common Dryer Repairs**
------------------------

According to [Fixr](https://www.fixr.com/costs/dryer-repair), the average cost for dryer repair services is between $100 and $200 (CAD 125 and CAD 250). However, keep in mind that this is just the median price. If it is a small problem like a broken door latch, you might be able to get a professional to fix it for around $50 (CAD 63). For larger problems like a broken drum, repairing the issue could cost as much as $450 (CAD 565).

Costs will also depend on the type of dryer you have. An electric dryer is usually less expensive to repair because this appliance is more common. If you have a gas dryer, you should expect repair prices to be higher. Gas dryer repairs are more expensive because parts can be harder to find. The problem may be related to your gas line, which can be expensive to repair.

**Ways to Save on Dryer Repairs**
---------------------------------

If the price of repairs sounds too high for you, you have a few alternatives. First of all, you can just replace your dryer. According to [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/home/when-to-repair-vs-replace-those-pricey-home-appliances/2017/05/26/9fa61cd0-3cc0-11e7-9e48-c4f199710b69_story.html), a good rule of thumb is that you should never pay more than half the current value of your machine for repairs. In these cases, you are better off getting a new dryer that may not break for several years.

Another option is repairing the dryer yourself. Smaller problems like a blocked vent, lint buildup, or a broken belt can be handled on your own. This can cut costs greatly. Instead of having to pay around [$60 to $70](https://www.thumbtack.com/p/appliance-repair-cost) (CAD 75 to CAD 88) per hour in labor, you just have to pay for the part yourself. In some cases, costs can end up being as cheap as [$10](https://krostrade.com/blog/how-much-does-it-cost-to-replace-a-dryer-belt/) (CAD 13) for a DIY dryer belt repair kit.

It is also important to do your homework and shop around before agreeing to dryer repairs. You can ask multiple companies for an estimate to find one with fair pricing. In some instances, you may be able to find parts for a lower price and just have to pay labor costs. You can also find dryers on sale, especially around major shopping holidays, and in the fall, right before the [new models come out](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbes-personal-shopper/2021/09/13/best-time-to-buy-washer-dryer/). If you can find one for cheap, it may be more reasonable to replace it rather than repair it.
