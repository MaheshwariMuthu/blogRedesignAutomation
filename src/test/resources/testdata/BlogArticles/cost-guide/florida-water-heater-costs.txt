  We’ve seen [what alligators will do to endure](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/01/25/scientists-say-these-frozen-alligators-arent-dead-theyre-still-creeping-people-out/) when the water gets _really_ cold, but it’s highly unlikely another group that populates Florida — _people_ — would take a bone-chilling bath lying down. But, if the humans’ water heaters suddenly go kerplunk, that predictably warm subtropical climate won’t be enough to get rid of the goosebumps — so unless you wanna go the way of the gator and just freeze in place with your snout in the air in hopes it’ll pass (it won’t), you’re gonna need to call for repairs. On the bright side, Sunshine State residents, generally speaking, you pay on par with the national average for water heater repairs, and significantly less than your fellow Americans for an outright replacement.

Your water heater powers your dishwasher, clothes washer and the hot shower you crave at the end of the day. When it goes kaput, it's not so much a matter of _whether_ you should have it serviced, but how much that service will cost. And if your hot water is already out, the last thing you want right now is to be blindsided by exorbitant water heater service fees. If you’re calling around for estimates, these figures should give you a ballpark idea of how much you can expect to pay, from the Panhandle to the Southernmost Point.

Repair and replacement costs vary depending on where you live. For comparison, the national average for diagnosis is $99, for repair is $493 and for replacement is $1,741.

The following average prices are based on aggregated HomeServe data reported by our network of contractors across the state of Florida:

Water Heater Diagnosis: $102
----------------------------

The technician will charge you a fee to come out to your home, tell you what’s wrong with your system and determine whether it needs to be repaired or replaced. For Floridians at large‚ this fee is a nominal $3 more than the national average.

Water Heater Repair: $494
-------------------------

Any number of things may be going wrong with your water heater — issues with the gas control valve, a faulty thermostat or a combination of several malfunctions. This average repair price includes replacement parts and the labor to install them. Water heater repairs in Florida cost roughly the same as they do nationwide.

Water Heater Replace: $1,469
----------------------------

Water heaters don’t last forever, and a breakdown might be a sign that yours is on its way out. At the end of your water heater’s usable life (about 10 years), you'll need to spring for a new one. Florida’s average replacement price is 16% less than that of the nation.

(Note that HomeServe water heater data should generally be assumed to refer to conventional “tanked” models — the most common type — as opposed to tankless or “on-demand” models, which can cost roughly twice as much.)
