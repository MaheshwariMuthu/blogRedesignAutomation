  Imagine this very likely scenario: You left the house keys sitting on the counter, and now you're locked out of the house. It's raining, the kids are complaining about getting wet, and — of course — the hidden spare key is gone because nobody put it back after the last lockout.

Getting locked out is an all-too-common occurrence that pretty much everyone can relate to. However, there is a way to avoid this stressor altogether. With a keyless lock, the need for a key is eliminated. All it takes to unlock the front door is a code or, depending on the lock, a smartphone. And luckily, they don't cost much more than traditional deadbolts.

How Much Does It Cost to Install a Keyless Door Lock?
-----------------------------------------------------

The average cost to install a keyless lock depends on the type installed and whether you install it yourself or pay a professional to do it for you. The average price to have a keyless door lock professionally installed is $330 (CAD 440), according to [LawnStarter](https://www.lawnstarter.com/blog/cost/smart-door-lock-installation-cost/#:~:text=Homeowners%20can%20expect%20to%20pay,%24200%20to%20%24460%20on%20average.&text=The%20national%20average%20cost%20to,somewhere%20between%20%24200%20and%20%24460.). This includes the price of the keyless lock and labor.

For the do-it-yourselfer, the cost is lower since there aren't labor charges. All that is needed in many cases is the lock, a screwdriver and time.

How Much Is the Unit Itself?
----------------------------

Keyless locks range in price from $90 to $360 (CAD 120 to CAD 480), depending on the type of lock and the features involved. Keypad locks, the most popular units, start at about $90 (CAD 120). All other types of keyless locks, including Wi-Fi, RFID, Bluetooth, biometric and Z-wave units, range in price from $110 to $360 (CAD 147 to CAD 480). Keyless locks vary in price based on the number of features included.

### How Do the Costs Compare Among the Different Types of Keyless Locks?

The most common type of keyless lock is a keypad lock, which costs between $90 and $300﻿ (CAD 120 and CAD 400). With this type of lock, the homeowner chooses a four-digit code that's used to open the lock. An RFID lock system uses a keycard, similar to the locks in hotel rooms. These cost between $110 and $300﻿ (CAD 147 and CAD 400).  Wi-Fi locks can be unlocked using a phone app as long it has access to Wi-Fi. Expect to pay between $200 and $300﻿ (CAD 266 and CAD 400).

Bluetooth locks cost between $170 and $260 (CAD 226 and CAD 346), and they can also be unlocked using a phone app. However, they're limited to a range of about 40 feet. Biometric locks use a combination of fingerprint and PIN numbers and cost between $200 and $350 (CAD 266 and CAD 466). Z-Wave locks, ranging in price from $240 to $360 (CAD 320 to CAD 480), connect to a hub that lets the homeowner control the lock from a smartphone or computer.

Professional Installation Vs. DIY
---------------------------------

It costs about $50 to $110 (CAD 67 to CAD 147) for professional installation of a keyless lock. This includes the cost of the unit itself and labor costs. The price could rise if a new door needs to be installed. Further costs include changing the doorknob.

A do-it-yourself installation is less expensive, as it only includes the cost of the keyless lock. It saves money, but you’ll have to handle the process and any unforeseen difficulties that may arise. When using a professional, the cost is higher, but you can rest assured that everything is taken care of.

How Does the Cost of a Keyless Lock Compare to a Conventional Lock?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Whether you install a keyless lock or a conventional lock, both can provide you with home security. The decision comes down to a matter of cost and convenience.

In general, the cost of installing a keyless lock is higher than that of installing a conventional lock. A keyless lock professionally installed costs between $200 and $460 (CAD 266 and CAD 613). According to [Porch.com](https://porch.com/project-cost/cost-to-install-a-door-lock), it costs between $145 and $300 (CAD 193 and CAD 400) to have a conventional lock professionally installed.

Is a Keyless Lock Worth It?
---------------------------

For the most part, keyless locks are more expensive than conventional locks. If convenience is the priority, keyless locks are worth the extra money. They are much easier to use since opening the door lock can be done with a code entry or by simply using a smartphone — no more looking around for a key.

One thing to keep in mind, though, is the possibility of power outages. Since some keyless locks work with Wi-Fi, a power outage can render them inoperative. In that case, nothing beats a good old-fashioned key-controlled deadbolt lock.
