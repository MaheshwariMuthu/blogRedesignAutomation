  _Sweet Home, Alabama,_ indeed. Y’all probably hear that a lot, but what’s _not_ so sweet in your Alabama home is a broken-down water heater — especially during the heavy humidity of a Deep South summer. No need to pitch a fit: Compared to the national average, it costs _less_ to repair your water heater in ’Bama. And in the event that you do have to chunk it, you’ll be relieved to know that the average water heater replacement price is lower in the Yellowhammer State, too.

Your water heater powers your dishwasher, clothes washer and the hot shower you crave at the end of the day. And if your water heater’s wore slap out, it's not so much a matter of _whether_ you should have it serviced, but how much that service will cost. The last thing you want right now is to be blindsided by exorbitant water heater service fees. If you’re calling around for estimates, these figures should give you a ballpark idea of how much you can expect to pay, from all the way up there in Huntsville down to the Gulf Coast.

Repair and replacement costs vary depending on where you live. For comparison, the national average for diagnosis is $99, for repair is $493 and for replacement is $1,741.

The following average prices are based on aggregated HomeServe data reported by our network of contractors across Alabama:

Water Heater Diagnosis: $87
---------------------------

The diagnostic fee is what the technician will charge you to tell you what’s wrong with your system and whether it needs to be repaired or replaced. In Alabama, this fee is about 12% lower than the national average.

Water Heater Repair: $405
-------------------------

Any of a number of things may be going wrong with your water heater — issues with the gas control valve, a faulty thermostat or a combination of several malfunctions. This average repair price includes replacement parts and the labor to install them. Repairs cost Alabamians an average of 18% less than the U.S. overall.

Water Heater Replace: $1,402
----------------------------

Water heaters only last about 10 years, so if it’s been a hot minute since you had yours installed, this breakdown might be a sign it’s finally given up the ghost. At the end of your water heater’s usable life, you'll need to spring for a new one. Alabama’s average replacement price is 19% less than the nation’s.

(Note that HomeServe water heater data should generally be assumed to refer to conventional “tanked” models — the most common type — as opposed to tankless or “on-demand” models, which can cost roughly twice as much.)
