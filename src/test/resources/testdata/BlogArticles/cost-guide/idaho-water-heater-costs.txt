  When their water heaters go out, Idahoans have a built-in remedy: They can still find a hot bath in one of the Gem State’s many natural hot springs. But that’s really more of a _temporary_ solution. Sorry to say it, but your bum water heater’s gonna need to be serviced. If it just needs some new parts, you’re in luck. On the whole, Idahoers pay less to repair their water heaters than the average American. But if you’re going to need a whole new unit, you’d better brace yourself. Water heater replacement prices are higher in Idaho than in most other states.

Your water heater powers your dishwasher, clothes washer and the hot shower you crave at the end of the day. When it goes kaput, it's not so much a matter of _whether_ you should have it serviced, but how much that service will cost. And if your hot water is already out, the last thing you want right now is to be blindsided by exorbitant water heater service fees. If you’re calling around for estimates, these figures should give you a ballpark idea of how much you can expect to pay, whether you live north or south of the Coeur d’Alene River.

Repair and replacement costs vary depending on where you live. For comparison, the national average for diagnosis is $99, for repair is $493 and for replacement is $1,741.

The following average prices are based on aggregated HomeServe data reported by our network of contractors across the state of Idaho.

Water Heater Diagnosis: $87
---------------------------

The diagnostic fee is what the technician will charge you to come out to your home, inspect your system and tell you whether it needs to be repaired or replaced. In Idaho, this fee is about 12% lower than the national average.

Water Heater Repair: $454
-------------------------

Any of a number of things may be going wrong with your water heater — issues with the gas control valve, a faulty thermostat or a combination of several malfunctions. This average repair price includes replacement parts and the labor to install them. Repairs cost Idahoans an average of 8% less than the U.S. overall.

Water Heater Replace: $1,942
----------------------------

Water heaters only last about 10 years, so a breakdown might be a sign that yours is on its way out. At the end of your water heater’s usable life, you'll need to spring for a new one. Idaho’s average replacement price is almost 12% higher than the nation’s.

(Note that HomeServe water heater data should generally be assumed to refer to conventional “tanked” models — the most common type — as opposed to tankless or “on-demand” models, which can cost roughly twice as much.)
