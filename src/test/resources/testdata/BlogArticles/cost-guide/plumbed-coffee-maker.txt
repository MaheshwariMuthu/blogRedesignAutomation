  For coffee enthusiasts, the first cup of fresh-brewed deliciousness is one of the most important aspects of the day. The coffee maker in your kitchen allows for quick preparation of your favorite pick-me-up. While most coffee makers are simple and convenient, refilling the water tank on a regular basis can become tedious, especially for those who consume several cups throughout the day.

The good news is that plumbed and built-in coffee makers eliminate the tank-filling step by connecting directly to your home’s water line. Read on to learn more about how much it’ll cost to install one of these coffee makers and how the systems work.

How Does a Plumbed Coffee Maker Work?
-------------------------------------

A plumbed coffee maker is similar in appearance to a standard countertop coffee maker, with the main difference being that the machine is designed with a connection port that connects to your home’s water supply line. The coffee makers are equipped with water filtration systems that filter the water before releasing it into the reservoir through a small hose.

Because the machines are connected to a water source, coffee lovers can enjoy unlimited pots of coffee without ever refilling the water tank. While the specifics of each model can vary, the water in a plumbed coffee maker is typically accessible with a simple push of a button.

The machines can be installed in a DIY fashion or with the help of a plumbing professional. Installation is fairly easy; however, you'll need to carefully follow the included instructions and ensure that the machine's hose is securely connected to your home water source. It's also important to clean and maintain your plumbed coffee maker as instructed. Limescale buildup is a common issue due to the continuous water supply.

How Much Does a Plumbed Coffee Maker Cost?
------------------------------------------

Plumbed coffee makers typically cost between $300 and $10,000 (CAD 398 and CAD 13,270), according to [Above Average Coffee](https://aboveaveragecoffee.com/best-plumbed-coffee-maker/). The price can vary depending on the specific model and any additional features. Plumbed coffee makers in commercial establishments such as coffee houses and restaurants typically fall at the higher end of that price range, as these models are specifically designed to produce high volumes of coffee on a daily basis.

For example, countertop plumbed coffee makers designed for home use start at approximately $339 (CAD 450), according to [Brew Express](https://brewexpress.com/countertop-10-cup-model-bec-110-bs.html). Direct-line espresso machines cost between $1,800 and $3,000 (CAD 2,389 and CAD 3,981), based on the models listed on [Espresso Outlet](https://www.espressooutlet.net/direct-water-connect/).

How Much Does a Built-in Coffee Maker Cost?
-------------------------------------------

Built-in coffee machines are typically also plumbed models, though not always. They’re set into a space in your wall, so they don’t take up space on your counter. They typically start from around $4,699 (CAD 6,235), like this [built-in coffee machine](https://www.mieleusa.com/e/built-in-coffee-machine-cva-7440-clean-touch-steel-11733860-p) by Miele.

Built-in coffee maker features include built-in bean grinders, smart displays, customized brewing options and automatic warmer shut-offs. The different features and capabilities of each model greatly contribute to the price variations, so it's always a good idea to research different models and determine the best features to suit your needs before making a purchase.

How Much Does It Cost to Connect a Coffee Maker to Your Water Line?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

If you follow the included instructions and connect the plumbed coffee maker to your home's water line yourself, the cost of installation is zero — minus what you paid for the coffee maker. If you're hesitant about hooking up the system on your own, or you're unfamiliar with the functions of your home plumbing system, it's a good idea to enlist the services of a professional.

The cost of installation can vary depending on the work needed and the specific rates of the plumbing contractor. According to [HomeGuide](https://homeguide.com/costs/plumber-cost), the national average range for plumbing service calls is $75 to $100 (CAD 100 to CAD 133) per hour, although you could pay up to $150 (CAD 199) per hour outside regular working times.

Why Are Plumbed and Built-In Coffee Makers So Expensive?
--------------------------------------------------------

One of the main reasons is the fact that plumbed coffee makers require water filters that can cost up to $200. The filters on plumbed coffee makers filter water from the water lines before it's pumped into the machine. Hiring a professional plumber to help with the installation can also add to the costs. The various features and fully automated designs make plumbed and built-in coffee makers considerably higher-priced than standard countertop coffee makers.
