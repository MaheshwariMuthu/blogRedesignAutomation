Carpets are ideal for adding softness and insulation, but it's essential to understand how much the project will cost before committing.

What Is the Average Cost to Install Carpet?
-------------------------------------------

Carpet installation costs around $800 to $2,000 (CAD 1,070 to CAD 2,675) for a 200-square-foot room, according to [Today's Homeowner](https://todayshomeowner.com/flooring/cost/carpet-installation-cost/). However, using premium materials could make carpet installation more expensive.

How Much Does Carpet Installation Cost Per Square Foot?
-------------------------------------------------------

How much you spend on carpet installation depends on your room size. Carpeting a room usually costs between $2 and $8 (CAD 2.67 and CAD 10.70) per square foot, including labor.

How Much Does Carpet Installation Labor Cost?
---------------------------------------------

Based on data from [HomeGuide](https://homeguide.com/costs/carpet-installation-cost)﻿, most carpet installers charge a minimum call-out fee between $75 and $150 (CAD 100 and CAD 201) and $35 to $80 (CAD 47 to CAD 107) per hour.

Some installers charge per square foot. You should expect to pay between 50 cents and $1.50 (CAD 0.67 and CAD 2.01) per square foot in labor fees. Installing carpets in awkward areas, such as staircases, can increase the cost of labor. Budget around $12 to $45 (CAD 16 to CAD 60) per step to install carpet on stairs, including materials and labor.

Carpet Installation Cost Factors
--------------------------------

Apart from the room size, the type of carpet you want to install and the condition of your floors can impact the cost of carpet installation. Considering the following factors can help you estimate your overall project costs.

### Installation Method

Wall-to-wall carpets are the most common type of domestic carpets. They come in large rolls, allowing installers to cover large areas with fewer pieces. Generally, wall-to-wall carpets cost between $1 and $4.50 (CAD 1.34 and CAD 6.02) per square foot, including labor, although you could pay up to $21 (CAD 28) per square foot for premium materials.

Glue-down carpets are ideal for covering solid floors made from materials such as concrete. However, you can't install padding underneath, making them feel harder underfoot. Expect to pay between $3 and $7 (CAD 4.01 and CAD 9.36) per square foot for glue-down carpet installation.

Carpet tiles can be a good option for commercial spaces and areas that need hard-wearing floors, and you can replace individual pieces if you damage them. Installing carpet tiles usually costs between $2 and $8 (CAD 2.67 and CAD 10.70) per square foot.

### Carpet Type

Carpets come in three main types: loop pile, cut pile and cut and loop. [Loop pile carpets](https://homeguide.com/costs/carpet-prices-per-square-foot) are generally the cheapest, costing between 50 cents and $8 (CAD 0.67 and CAD 10.70) per square foot. These carpets have tight yarn loops that make them more durable and easy to clean. However, they feel harder than other carpet types.

Meanwhile, cut pile carpets cost between 60 cents and $9 (CAD 0.80 and CAD 12.04) per square foot and feature cut yarn loops. They're less durable than other carpet types but could be a good choice for low-traffic areas if you prefer a softer feel.

The most expensive type is cut and loop carpet, which has cut loops to create a textured finish. Cut and loop carpets are ideal for concealing wear and tear and offer average durability. They're also easier to clean than cut pile carpets. Expect to pay between $1 and $9 (CAD 1.34 and CAD 12.04) per square foot, according to HomeGuide.

### Material

Carpets come in natural yarns, such as wool or sisal, and artificial fibers, such as nylon and polyester. Polyester carpets﻿ are generally the most affordable, costing between 50 cents and $1.50 (CAD 0.67 and CAD 2.01) per square foot, excluding installation labor. Meanwhile, wool carpets﻿ are the most expensive, coming in between $6 and $21 (CAD 8.02 and CAD 28) per square foot.

### Extra Costs

If you have existing carpets, you'll need to remove them first. According to [HomeGuide](https://homeguide.com/costs/carpet-removal-cost), removing an existing carpet costs between 70 cents and $1.60 (CAD 0.94 and CAD 2.14) per square foot for wall-to-wall carpeting and 75 cents to $1.80 (CAD 1 to CAD 2.41) per square foot for a glue-down carpet.

You'll also need to remove any furniture from the room. Many homeowners choose to remove furniture themselves, but you may require professional assistance to move heavy or awkward items. Expect to pay a contractor between $25 and $75 (CAD 33 and CAD 100) to clear the room.

If you have a damaged subfloor, your installer may recommend repairing or replacing it before laying a new carpet. Based on data from [Fixr](https://www.fixr.com/costs/subfloor-repair), subfloor repairs usually come in between $250 and $750 (CAD 334 and CAD 1,003) (depending on the size of the room), but you may need to pay significantly more if you need to replace the subfloor.
