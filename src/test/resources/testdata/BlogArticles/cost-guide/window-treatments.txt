Curtains, blinds, shades and more: Here’s how much they’ll cost to install.

Are Window Treatments Expensive?
--------------------------------

Window treatments can be expensive, but they don't have to be. Basic blinds for a small or mid-size window — including installation hardware or rods — can run as low as $10 (CAD 13), according to [Thumbtack](https://www.thumbtack.com/p/blind-installation-cost). Designer window treatments may cost hundreds or even thousands of dollars, especially for large specialty windows.

### What Is the Least Expensive Window Treatment?

Inexpensive curtains are often the most affordable window treatments. You may be able to pick up budget curtains from home furnishing stores for as little as [$7 to $20](https://home.costhelper.com/curtains-drapes.html) (CAD 9 to CAD 26) a panel.

Types of Window Treatments
--------------------------

How much window blinds, shades or curtains cost depends on a variety of factors, including the size of your windows, the material and where you buy them. Here's a look at some average price ranges for different types of shades, drapes and blinds:

### How Much Do Curtains Cost?

Prices for curtains can range from $7 to $20 (CAD 9 to CAD 26) per panel for basic curtains, up to between $250 and $1,500 (CAD 330 and CAD 2,000) or more for custom or designer panels.

So what’s the average cost? Inexpensive fabrics in basic designs from retailers such as Walmart, Target, Big Lots or Amazon cost $15 to $40 (CAD 20 to CAD 50) per panel or panel pair. You can buy curtains one panel at a time or in sets to cover a window.

More expensive fabrics, which can include linen or silk, may cost $20 to $150 (CAD 26 to CAD 200) per panel or more. Lined curtains meant to support energy efficiency, such as thermal or blackout curtains, often cost about the same price.

Typically, the bigger your windows and the more area you want to cover with curtains, the higher the price.

If you're installing curtains, you may also have to buy curtain rods and installation hardware. Other expenses could include valances, cornices, finials and other decorative items, depending on how you want the windows to look when you're done. These additional items can add between $5 and $600 (CAD 6 and CAD 790) or more, depending on how elaborate you want to get.

### How Much Do Blinds Cost?

The cost of blinds depends on what type of blinds you purchase and how big your windows are. PVC or fabric blinds tend to cost less than wood slats, for example.

Slat blinds, which are also often called mini blinds, cost $6 to $90 (CAD 8 to CAD 120) per window, depending on size and material, according to [Bob Vila](https://www.bobvila.com/articles/how-much-do-blinds-cost/). Vertical blinds, or Roman blinds, start around $30 (CAD 40) per window. Roller blinds, which are usually a long piece of fabric or woven pieces that unroll to cover the window, can cost $8 to $190 (CAD 10 to CAD 250) per window.

As with curtains, if you want specialty, designer or custom blinds, you will likely pay much more. Most store-bought blinds do come with the basic hardware you'll need to hang them, so you don't typically have to worry about a lot of extra costs there.

### How Much Do Shades Cost?

The price of window shades also varies by size, type and material. [Bankrate](https://www.bankrate.com/homeownership/how-much-do-window-shades-cost/) says average prices range from around $110 to $320 (CAD 140 to CAD 420) per window, with designer or custom options costing much more.

You may need to purchase hardware or other materials to install shades, depending on what type you invest in. That extra cost ranges between $5 and $40 (CAD 6 and CAD 50) per window.

How Much Does Installation Cost?
--------------------------------

If you're opting for discount blinds and shades or other affordable window coverings, you'll probably just install them yourself. Custom curtains, blinds and shades may call for professional installation — especially if you want them to look and function their best. These types of jobs might even call for extra steps, such as removing screens or adding molding to windows.

Installation costs vary depending on where you live and who you hire. According to data from [HomeGuide](https://homeguide.com/costs/handyman-prices), a handyman may charge $50 to $80 (CAD 65 to CAD 100) per hour.

Professional window dressers may charge a per-window fee for installation. [Porch.com](https://porch.com/project-cost/cost-to-install-window-blinds) says that might start at about $30 (CAD 40) or more per window — and it might cost much more if you didn't buy the window coverings from the same company that's doing the installation.

Factors That Impact Window Treatment Cost
-----------------------------------------

The type of window covering you choose — from basic fabric blinds to designer drapes — impacts the overall cost. Here are some other factors that can affect how much you pay for window treatments:

### Size

The larger the area to cover, the more material you need. And that means more expensive window coverings. Some people choose curtains that are designed only to cover part of a window to help cut down on costs while also creating a decorative look. It’s also cheaper to cover standard-size windows because some treatments come precut. If you have custom windows, you may need custom coverings.

### Material

Custom and luxury materials and fabrics will cost more. Thicker curtain fabric or curtains with more layers also cost more. That's why sheers — curtains made of very thin material you can see through — are often the least expensive option.

### Decorative Elements

A curtain rod can cost a couple of dollars on the low end, and installation hardware for blinds is often free and comes in the box. But if you want something more, you may end up paying a lot for it. Decorative finials, specialty coverings to create seamless visuals with blinds or tie-back hooks can all increase the cost of installation.

### Specialty Care

Most window coverings are fairly easy to care for. However, if you purchase custom window treatments, you may want to pay someone to clean or maintain them occasionally or invest in specialty equipment, such as a steam-cleaning system, to do it yourself properly. This can help lengthen the life of the window treatments to protect your investment.

Reasons to Invest in Window Coverings
-------------------------------------

Window coverings can be a pricey addition to your home decor. Even if you opt for affordable window coverings, the cost adds up based on how many windows you have. Here are some of the reasons people consider window covers to be a wise investment:

### Privacy

Depending on where you live, people might be able to peek into your home through your windows. Drawing the curtains or pulling down the shades is an easy way to keep your business to yourself.

### The Look

Curtains and other window coverings are a great way to add color and visual appeal to your rooms.

### Energy Efficiency

Window coverings block sunlight during warm months to help keep the interior of your home cool. During the cooler months, they can keep cold air out and help block drafts. Thermal or energy-efficient curtains and blinds help with this even more and might even contribute to reducing your utility bills. That potential savings could help make up for some of the investment.

How Often Do You Need to Replace Window Coverings?
--------------------------------------------------

Quality curtains, blinds or other window treatments can last for years, especially when they're installed correctly and maintained well. That's another reason to invest in window treatments that you really like; you may also want to consider neutral curtains or blinds that will work with future changes you make to the room's decor.

Make sure to follow the manufacturer's instructions when using blinds or shades to keep from breaking them. Use dusting or cleaning tools to keep them clean. Curtains are often a bit easier to maintain, as you can take them down for washing, steaming or dry cleaning as needed. Deep clean window coverings at least twice a year to cut down on dust and other issues that can collect in these areas.
