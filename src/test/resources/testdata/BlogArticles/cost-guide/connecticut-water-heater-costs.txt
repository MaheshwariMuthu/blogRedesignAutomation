  Connecticut may have an unfair (if not _entirely_ unfounded) reputation as New York’s biggest bedroom community, but it’s also known for rustic coastal charm and scenic serenity just far enough away from the hustle and bustle of the Big City. But “bedroom community” quickly turns to “bathroom calamity” if a neglected water heater gives out just as you step in the shower after cleaning the day’s catch on the docks. So, in the interest of being prepared by budgeting for eventual maintenance emergencies, it’ll be helpful to know that what homeowners are charged for water heater repair and replacement in the Constitution State constitutes more or less the same price the average American pays.

Your water heater powers your dishwasher, clothes washer and the hot shower you crave at the end of the day. When it goes kaput, it's not so much a matter of _whether_ you should have it serviced, but how much that service will cost. And if your hot water is already out, the last thing you want right now is to be blindsided by exorbitant water heater service fees. If you’re calling around for estimates, these figures should give you a ballpark idea of how much you can expect to pay, from Hartford to Stamford.

Repair and replacement costs vary depending on where you live. For comparison, the national average for diagnosis is $99, for repair is $493 and for replacement is $1,741.

The following average prices are based on aggregated HomeServe data reported by our network of contractors across the state of Connecticut:

Water Heater Diagnosis: $59
---------------------------

The technician will charge you a fee to come out to your home, tell you what’s wrong with your system and determine whether it needs to be repaired or replaced. For Connecticuters at large‚ this fee is 40% less than the national average.

Water Heater Repair: $509
-------------------------

Any number of things may be going wrong with your water heater — issues with the gas control valve, a faulty thermostat or a combination of several malfunctions. This estimated repair price includes replacement parts and the labor to install them. Water heater repairs cost the average Connecticut resident a nominal 3% more than they do nationwide.

Water Heater Replace: $1,590
----------------------------

Water heaters don’t last forever, and a breakdown might be a sign that yours is on its way out. At the end of your water heater’s usable life (about 10 years), you'll need to spring for a new one. Connecticut’s average replacement price is roughly 9% less than that of the nation.

(Note that HomeServe water heater data should generally be assumed to refer to conventional “tanked” models — the most common type — as opposed to tankless or “on-demand” models, which can cost roughly twice as much.)
