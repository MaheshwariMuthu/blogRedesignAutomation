  Mountaineers are always free — but water heater repairs and replacements are not. Got a water heater that’s given up the ghost? West Virginians can rest easy: It costs less to repair or replace your water heater in the Mountain State than the national average.

Your water heater is a pretty important piece of equipment. It’s responsible for your clean clothes, spotless dishes and that hot shower you’re looking forward to. When it goes kaput, it's not so much a matter of _whether_ you should have it serviced, but how much that service will cost. And if your hot water is already out, the last thing you want is to be slapped with sky-high service fees. Curious what it might cost? These figures should give you a ballpark idea of how much you can expect to pay, from the Northern Panhandle to Greenbrier Valley.

Repair and replacement costs vary depending on where you live. For comparison, the national average for diagnosis is $99, for repair is $493 and for replacement is $1,741.

The following average prices are based on aggregated HomeServe data reported by our network of contractors across West Virginia.

Water Heater Diagnosis: $81
---------------------------

The diagnostic fee is what the technician will charge you to tell you what’s wrong with your system and whether it needs to be repaired or replaced. In West Virginia, this fee is about 18% lower than the national average.

Water Heater Repair: $393
-------------------------

Any of a number of things may be going wrong with your water heater — issues with the gas control valve, a faulty thermostat or a combination of several malfunctions. This average repair price includes replacement parts and the labor to install them. Repairs cost West Virginians an average of 20% less than the U.S. overall.

Water Heater Replace: $1,423
----------------------------

Water heaters don’t last forever, and a breakdown might be a sign that yours is on its way out. At the end of your water heater’s usable life (about 10 years), you'll need to spring for a new one. West Virginia’s average replacement price is 18% less than the nation’s.

(Note that HomeServe water heater data should generally be assumed to refer to conventional “tanked” models — the most common type — as opposed to tankless or “on-demand” models, which can cost roughly twice as much.)
