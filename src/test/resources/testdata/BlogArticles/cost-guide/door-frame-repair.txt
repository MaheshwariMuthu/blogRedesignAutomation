  **Doorframe Repair and Replacement Costs at a Glance**

* **Average repair cost:** 80-$165 (CAD 105-CAD 215)
* **Interior doorframe replacement cost:** $115-$220 (CAD 150-CAD 290)
* **Exterior doorframe replacement cost:** $130-$380 (CAD 170-CAD 500)

Doorframes are critical elements for both interior and exterior doors. They help maintain structural integrity, provide lasting support for the door and ensure that the door hangs level to the floor. There are several factors that determine the cost to replace a doorframe, such as the style of door, type of material and its location.

Like everything else in your home, doorframes are susceptible to wear and tear, weather damage and other issues like sagging, sticking and swelling. Whether you opt to do it yourself or hire a professional contractor, replacing or repairing a doorframe can enhance your entryway. Here’s a look at how much it costs.

Doorframe Repair Cost
---------------------

According to [HomeGuide](https://homeguide.com/costs/door-frame-replacement-or-repair-cost#repair), the average cost to repair a doorframe is $80 to $165 (CAD 105 to CAD 215). Repairing a French doorframe costs around $210 (CAD 275), though, because these doors have different types of frames than standard doors, and they may be more expensive to repair.

You should expect to pay between $100 and $240 (CAD 130 and CAD 315) to fix a sliding doorframe, and between $40 and $280 (CAD 50 to CAD 365) to repair a pocket doorframe.

You might discover you feel comfortable tackling certain repair tasks yourself. Here are some examples of what might need to be repaired on a doorframe:

*   Tightening hinges
*   Sanding
*   Adding insulated tape
*   Caulking

Repairing a doorframe might cost less than replacing a doorframe or installing a new door. But if your doorframe is damaged extensively or requires repairs beyond simple fixes — like if it has a sagging frame, jammed door or damaged hinges — you will probably want to call a handyman or carpenter to help you.

Door Jambs, Doorframes and Hinges — What’s the Difference?
----------------------------------------------------------

Before you start your repair or replacement, you’ll want to know a few vocabulary terms. Understanding the difference between the key elements of a doorframe will help you work with confidence.

A door jamb is one main part of the doorframe; specifically, it’s the flat surface that runs vertically up either side of the doorframe. This is the area where door hinges are installed to hold up the door.  The doorframe refers to the entire unit that supports the door and all its components. Replacing a door jamb often includes replacing the entire doorframe.

Doorframe Replacement Cost
--------------------------

If you decide to replace your doorframe instead of repairing it, the installation cost will vary based on whether the door is outside or inside, according to [HomeGuide](https://homeguide.com/costs/door-frame-replacement-or-repair-cost#repair). The total installation cost also depends on the type of doorframe you install. For example, a standard doorframe costs between $50 to $70 (CAD 65 to CAD 90), while steel doorframes run about $100 to $130 (CAD 130 to CAD 170).

A professional contractor, handyman or carpenter can hang and install the doorframe in a few hours. If your contractor charges by the hour instead of a flat fee, use this estimate to calculate how much installation may cost.

### Interior Doorframe Replacement Cost

You can replace a basic interior doorframe for about $115 to $220 (CAD 150 to CAD 290). What you pay will be based on the style, size and quality of your door and frame. Specialty doors, like French, sliding or barn doors, require different types of frames that typically cost more.

There are a lot of options available when it comes to replacing your doorframe. You can replace a doorframe and door at the same time with a pre-hung door system, or you can just replace the doorframe. Based on prices from [Lowes](https://www.lowes.com/search?searchTerm=interior%20prehung%20doors&refinement=1287754666), a pre-hung doorframe kit costs between $100 and $400 (CAD 130 and CAD 520). Pre-hung door kits come with a door already mounted to the frame and typically include hinge hardware and predrilled openings for a handle and lock.

### Exterior Doorframe Replacement Cost

According to [HomeGuide](https://homeguide.com/costs/door-frame-replacement-or-repair-cost#repair), the cost to replace or repair exterior doorframes is between $130 and $380 (CAD 170 and CAD 500), depending on materials and size. Several styles are available, and the final cost depends on the material you choose.

Interior Vs. Exterior Doorframes
--------------------------------

Exterior doors are typically heavier and sturdier than interior doors. They’re usually constructed with wood, fiberglass or steel with frames to match. Exterior doors also play an important role in security, safety and entry, so they generally include deadbolts. Interior doors may be less heavy-duty. Both types of doors are constructed differently and, as a result, require different types of doorframes. Consider these factors when replacing either an interior or exterior doorframe:

### Width

The standard exterior door is 36 inches wide, while the standard interior door is 30 inches wide. Doorframes must match the width of the door.

### Weather Resistance

Exterior doors and doorframes are built to withstand a variety of outdoor elements. They’re usually made of heavy materials designed to hold up to extreme weather conditions. Interior doors don't have to be weather-resistant.

### Security

Exterior doors include locks and deadbolts. Strong frames are necessary to hold exterior doors. If the exterior doorframe is weak or damaged, it can be easily broken. Interior doors may also have locks, but they generally don't have deadbolts.
