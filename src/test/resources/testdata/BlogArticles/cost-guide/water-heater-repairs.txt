If your water heater is on the fritz and you wind up needing just a repair versus a total replacement, you’re in luck. The national average cost for water heater repairs is less than a third of what it would cost you for a total unit replacement. According to HomeServe data, the average water heater repair totals less than $500 compared with a replacement, which’ll run you more than $1,700 on average.

Several variables will go into the calculation of what you’ll ultimately pay for your water heater repairs. First off, don’t forget to factor in an average $99 diagnostic fee — as the contractor you call almost certainly will charge you to show up and determine what’s wrong and how to fix it. Moreover, it’s likely that the problem will be the result of a combination of factors, which in turn will necessitate a combination of solutions carrying their own individual costs that, taken together, figure into the national average.

Read on for a rundown on the common causes of a water heater breakdown and their associated costs for repair, plus a state-by-state breakdown of average water heater repair costs to help you get an idea of what you should expect to pay where you live, all told.

For a broader look at water heater pricing, check out our [cost guide covering pricing averages for both repair and replacement](https://www.homeserve.com/en-us/blog/cost-guide/repair-or-replace-water-heater/) state by state. And for a deeper dive into what factors into how much you’ll pay to get your water heater replaced outright, go to our [state-by-state replacement cost guide](https://www.homeserve.com/en-us/blog/cost-guide/water-heater-replacement-cost/).

All figures are based on aggregated HomeServe data reported by our network of thousands of contractors across the nation. Where insufficient data was available to determine a verifiable average, we’ve noted so. Also note that HomeServe water heater data should generally be assumed to refer to conventional “tanked” models — the most common type — as opposed to tankless or “on-demand” models, which can cost roughly twice as much.
