Installing an epoxy floor is a long-lasting and relatively inexpensive way to coat your garage floor. Here's a guide to how much an epoxy garage floor costs so you can plan your project.

What Is Epoxy Flooring?
-----------------------

Epoxy is a type of resin that, when mixed with hardeners, cures to form a tough material ideal for coating garage and kitchen floors that need to withstand heavy use. The epoxy coating is usually 2 millimeters thick or so, and it bonds firmly to the floor substrate.

The process to install an epoxy floor has several steps. First, an etching chemical is applied to create a rough surface for the epoxy to stick to. Next, the installer rinses and primes the floor and then applies the epoxy in two or more coats. You can apply most types of epoxy with a roller, and some brands are self-leveling. The epoxy then needs to cure, and you can usually start using your floor as normal after around 72 hours. Most epoxy floors need around seven days to fully cure.

There are various decorative epoxy options to choose from, including terrazzo epoxy and mixtures containing decorative flakes. Some epoxy mixtures contain gravel or quartz sand to create an attractive finish and give the floor nonslip qualities.

Pros and Cons of an Epoxy Floor
-------------------------------

Epoxy floors are often a good solution for garage floors, but they're not suitable in every scenario. Understanding the advantages and disadvantages of epoxy can help you decide if it's the right flooring option for your garage.

### Pros

*   Relatively affordable to purchase and install compared to other hard-wearing flooring types
*   Plenty of decorative options available
*   Can withstand contact with oil
*   Easy to clean and maintain
*   Durable and longer-lasting than most other garage floor types, apart from sealed concrete
*   Protects the substrate from moisture and damage
*   Reflects light to improve garage visibility

### Cons

*   Becomes very slippery when wet, unless you choose a nonslip epoxy containing gravel or sand
*   Lengthy substrate preparation and application process
*   Must be applied correctly to avoid weakness and adherence issues
*   Difficult and time-consuming to remove and replace
*   Smells strongly during application and curing
*   Does not allow moisture to escape from the substrate, which could cause buckling or bubbling if the application surface isn't completely dry

How Much Does an Epoxy Garage Floor Cost?
-----------------------------------------

According to [HomeGuide](https://homeguide.com/costs/epoxy-flooring-cost#diy), an epoxy floor costs between $4 and $10 (CAD 5.49 and CAD 14) per square foot to install, including labor costs. The overall project price depends on your garage's floor area, how much labor costs where you live, and the type of epoxy used. Water-based epoxy is significantly cheaper than solid epoxy. The project will also be more expensive if your floor requires multiple coats.

You could save money by doing the installation yourself if you have the time and DIY skills. The materials and equipment for installing epoxy floors generally cost around $50 to $600 (CAD 69 to CAD 824) per project.

How Long Do Epoxy Garage Floors Last?
-------------------------------------

You can expect an epoxy garage floor to last between [three and five years](https://www.bobvila.com/articles/best-garage-floor-paint/) on average, but some premium brands last significantly longer than this. Your floor should maintain its appearance without chipping during its expected life span, even if you drive cars over it or spill oil on it.

However, your epoxy floor could wear prematurely if you apply it to a damp substrate or don't follow the application instructions correctly. Driving over the floor with hot tires could also cause damage, so if you live in a hot climate, it’s worth investing in epoxy made to withstand this.
