You’re just about to head up north for the weekend — perhaps you’re going all the way to the U.P., or maybe you’re just hiking over to the thumb — when you discover your water heater’s gone out. Here’s the good news: No matter what part of the mitten you reside in, you can expect to pay less for water heater repairs or replacements than the average American.

Your water heater powers your dishwasher, clothes washer and the hot shower you crave at the end of the day. When it goes kaput, it's not so much a matter of _whether_ you should have it serviced, but how much that service will cost. And if your hot water is already out, the last thing you want right now is to be blindsided by exorbitant water heater service fees. If you’re calling around for estimates, these figures should give you a ballpark idea of how much you can expect to pay in the Great Lakes State.

Repair and replacement costs vary depending on where you live. For comparison, the national average for diagnosis is $99, for repair is $493 and for replacement is $1,741.

The following average prices are based on aggregated HomeServe data reported by our network of contractors across the state of Michigan:

Water Heater Diagnosis: $82
---------------------------

The technician will charge you a fee to come out to your home, tell you what’s wrong with your system and determine whether it needs to be repaired or replaced. For Michiganders (or Michiganians, if you insist)‚ this fee is about 17% lower than the national average.

Water Heater Repair: $236
-------------------------

What _can_ go wrong _will_ go wrong, right? Whether you’ve got issues with the gas control valve, a faulty thermostat or something else, repair costs vary based on the price of replacement parts. This average repair price includes those replacement parts, plus the labor to install them. Water heater repairs in Michigan cost less than half of what they do nationwide.

Water Heater Replace: $1,464
----------------------------

Water heaters don’t last forever, and a breakdown might be a sign that yours is on its way out. At the end of your water heater’s usable life (about 10 years), you'll need to spring for a new one. Michigan’s average replacement price is 16% less than the nation’s.

(Note that HomeServe water heater data should generally be assumed to refer to conventional “tanked” models — the most common type — as opposed to tankless or “on-demand” models, which can cost roughly twice as much.)
