Thinking of replacing your current tiles or installing new ones? Costs can vary based on the type of tiles you want and where you plan to put them. Here’s a detailed guide on tile costs.

Tile Installation Costs
-----------------------

The cost of tile installation includes the tiles, labor and additional materials. At the most basic level, you can expect to pay between [$6.25 and $16](https://www.costimates.com/costs/bathrooms/ceramic-tile-floor-install/) (CAD 8 to CAD 21) per square foot for a standard ceramic tile floor — or about [$3,500](https://www.fixr.com/costs/install-tile-floor) (CAD 4,600) in total.

The price varies from there based on:

*   Contractor’s labor costs
*   Size and type of space to be tiled
*   Type of tile used

Labor Cost to Install Tile
--------------------------

According to [HomeGuide](https://homeguide.com/costs/tile-installation-cost#laborcost), the labor cost for installing tiles is about $5 to $35 (CAD 6 to CAD 45) per square foot. The lower end of that price range is for floor tiling, while labor costs for a backsplash or countertop are on the upper end.

While most installers charge per square foot, some charge by the hour. Depending on the project's size and complexity, you can expect to pay about $60 to $95 (CAD 80 to CAD 125) per hour.

Request a written estimate from a reputable tile installation contractor to gauge the cost of completing the project.

Average Tile Installation Costs by Project
------------------------------------------

Tile installation cost depends on whether you're installing backsplash, countertop, floor or bathroom tiles. If you’re retiling, add about $560 to $1,140 (CAD 730 to CAD 1,500) for the removal and disposal of old tiles. Unglazed tile requires sealant, which can add $100 to $500 (CAD 130 to CAD 650) to the cost, according to [Fixr](https://www.fixr.com/costs/tile-and-grout-cleaning).

These are some of the most commonly tiled areas:

### Cost to Tile a Shower

Shower tiles can cost anywhere from [$8 to $40](https://homeguide.com/costs/tile-installation-cost#shower) (CAD 10 to CAD 50) per square foot, depending on the tiles selected. Including the cost of other materials and labor, you can expect the project to cost somewhere in the range of $800 to $10,000 (CAD 1,000 to CAD 13,000).

### Cost to Tile a Bathroom

Cost for bathroom tiles varies based on square footage, the number of walls and the material you plan on using. Most homeowners pay an average of $7 to $25 (CAD 9 to CAD 32) per square foot.

Tiling a bathroom floor differs from tiling walls because working around sinks, toilets and other fixtures can make it a complicated job. Most homeowners pay an average of $300 to $600 (CAD 390 to CAD 780) to tile the floors of a standard bathroom.

### Cost to Tile a Walk-in Shower

Most standard walk-in showers measure 84 square feet and typically cost [$800 to $3,000](https://homeguide.com/costs/cost-to-retile-shower-or-bathroom#walk-in) (CAD 1,000 to CAD 3,900) to tile, depending on your shower size and the type of tile.

### Cost to Install a Kitchen Backsplash

Installing a kitchen backsplash typically costs around $23 to $35 (CAD 30 to CAD 45) per square foot. Some prefer glass tiles as a kitchen backsplash because they’re easy to clean and tile patterns come pre-assembled. Glass tile installation will cost around $32 (CAD 41) per square foot.

The installation cost depends on the material you choose to use for the backsplash, with most homeowners paying about $600 to $1,200 (CAD 780 to CAD 1,600).

### Cost to Tile a Floor

Project price [varies](https://www.remodelingexpense.com/costs/cost-of-ceramic-tile-flooring/) based on the type and size of the area you’re tiling. For example, tiling the kitchen floor typically costs $975 to $1,950 (CAD 1,270 to CAD 2,550) for a standard kitchen of 130 square feet. Costs could go up to about $2,800 (CAD 3,650) for a larger space.

### Cost to Tile a Kitchen Countertop

[Kitchen countertop](https://homeguide.com/costs/tile-installation-cost#countertops) tiles range in price from about $30 to $90 (CAD 40 to CAD 115) per square foot, labor costs excluded.

Tile Replacement and Removal Costs
----------------------------------

Before replacing tiles, a professional contractor will remove the existing tile first. Removal of existing tiles costs around [$3 per square foot](https://homeguide.com/costs/tile-installation-cost#countertops) (CAD 4). The cement backer board underneath the tile costs roughly $6 (CAD 8) per square foot to replace.

Tile Costs by Type
------------------

Depending on the material used for tiling, the cost varies. Some of the most commonly used [tiling materials](https://www.thumbtack.com/p/tile-installation-cost) include:

### Ceramic

Ceramic tiles are a common choice because they are similar in durability to porcelain but half the price. Ceramic tile costs $7 to $14 (CAD 9 to CAD 18) per square foot, including installation labor.

They're most often installed in high-traffic areas, like hallways. Even if exposed to direct sunlight repeatedly, they remain colorfast. Ceramic tiles are stain-resistant, robust, durable and moisture resistant. Compared to porcelain, ceramic tiles don't score as easily.

Some of the key advantages of ceramic tiles:

*   You have a variety of colors, shapes and sizes to choose from
*   They're scratch- and stain-resistant
*   They're easy to install and pocket-friendly

The only disadvantage of ceramic tiles is that [grout](https://www.homeserve.com/en-us/blog/how-to/clean-grout/) is prone to discoloration.

### Porcelain

Porcelain tile averages around $12 to $19 (CAD 15 to CAD 25) per square foot on average. They come glazed or unglazed. Depending on where it’s installed, unglazed tile may require sealant for added moisture resistance, which can increase the total cost. Porcelain is among the most common tiling material choices because of its ability to resist stains and keep moisture at bay.

Porcelain is often installed in areas where there's a high moisture presence, like shower stalls, bathroom floors and walls, laundry rooms and kitchen backsplashes. They are also dense enough to withstand heavy traffic.

Some of the main features of porcelain tiles:

*   Cost-effective
*   Withstand freezing temperatures
*   Various finishes like matte, textured, glazed, unglazed, gloss and semi-gloss.
*   Easy to clean

However, if porcelain tile chips, it can be difficult to repair.

### Glass Tile

Glass tiles typically cost around $25 (CAD 32) per square foot. However, glass tiles are fragile and aren't recommended for flooring as they dent or break easily. And when they do break, they’re not easy to repair. They're better for backsplashes, countertops and bathroom areas.

Some advantages of glass tiles:

*   They're easy to clean.
*   They come in a variety of colors, patterns and shading options.

### Natural Stone

The average price for natural stone tile is about $13 to $20 (CAD 17 to CAD 25) per square foot. The tiles have a distinct look because all the stones are slightly different. Most homeowners prefer the natural look for flooring, countertops, bathrooms and backsplashes.

One downside is that natural stone requires annual sealing. The tiles aren’t as durable as ceramic and are prone to scratches and dents.
