The average lifespan of a water heater is somewhere in the neighborhood of 10 years, which seems like an eternity until that day comes when you suddenly find yourself mid-shower without hot water. Where _does_ the time go? The deceptive nature of having too much time to plan for the worst has left you with soap in your eyes and chill down your spine, a malfunctioning or possibly kaput water heater — and no earthly idea of whether you need to repair it or replace it nor what it’s gonna cost to do either.

Getting a precise answer to that question hinges on a number of variables that you _literally can’t even with_ right now, and you’re not exactly in the position to make a bunch of phone calls to compare contractor quotes. Calm down and towel off. We’ve got you.

To help you get at least a ballpark idea of what you should expect to pay before you start calling around for estimates, HomeServe has calculated the average costs for water heater repair and replacement nationally and state by state for comparison. Remember, whomever you hire to come and address your issue will almost certainly charge you a fee just to come out and diagnose the problem, so we’ve calculated that average as well.

But for our purposes here — to get you an immediate idea of the cold, hard cash you’ll have to drop in order to resume your warm, soothing shower — consult our quick reference guide below. There you’ll find what the average cost for water heater repair and replacement is in your state and how it compares to the national average.

All figures are based on aggregated HomeServe data reported by our network of thousands of contractors across the nation. Where insufficient data was available to determine a verifiable average, we’ve noted so. Also note that HomeServe water heater data should generally be assumed to refer to conventional “tanked” models — the most common type — as opposed to tankless or “on-demand” models, which can cost roughly twice as much.
