Laminate countertops, [popular in the 1950s and 1960s](https://www.thespruce.com/laminate-countertops-want-love-1822075), lost their popularity over time because some saw the material as a cheap alternative better suited to a former generation. However, with recent advances in technology, laminate countertops have made a comeback. They are now engineered to be more durable and are easily customizable, giving them a competitive place among the more expensive countertop materials.

How Much Do Laminate Countertops Cost?
--------------------------------------

According to [Better Homes and Gardens](https://www.bhg.com/kitchen/countertop/laminate-countertop-guide/), laminate countertops cost between $20 to $60 per square foot. It's one of the least expensive countertop options available and is far less expensive than other countertop materials. Prices can vary based on pattern and color selection. Custom edge treatments can also drive up the cost.

In contrast, popular materials like granite will cost $40 to $100 per square foot, quartz $55 to $75 per square foot and marble $40 to $180 per square foot. This makes laminate the cost-effective choice for those on a budget.

Installation Costs
------------------

To keep costs down, you can choose to install a laminate countertop yourself. It is a realistic option, since laminate is far lighter than other countertop materials such as granite and quartz. You won't have to lug around a big slab of stone that would need two or three people to maneuver. By installing laminate yourself, you only pay for the material.

If you want to hire a professional, installation costs will rise. The professional will build and install the countertop at an average of $55 per square foot. If you want added particulars like custom edge treatments, the cost typically goes up even more. The professional option may be more expensive, but if you’re not very handy, it might be best to let someone else take care of it. Mistakes can be costly, especially if you need to replace the entire countertop.

Laminate Pros and Cons
----------------------

One advantage that laminate has over other countertop materials is that it is amazingly customizable. Laminate counters can be engineered to have a pattern and finish strikingly similar to stone, so you can get the look of granite or quartz without paying the high price.

With laminates, it's easy to match your options to the style of your kitchen, including edge finishes. There are standard squared and rounded options or more creative choices such as beveled, ogee or waterfall edges. Similar options using other countertop materials like granite would significantly raise the cost of your project over that of laminate.

While laminate countertops are definitely a low-cost option, some care must be taken when using this material to ensure it lasts a long time. [HGTV](https://www.hgtv.com/design/remodel/kitchen-remodel/laminate-countertops) says laminate scratches easily, so make sure you use a cutting board when slicing or dicing. The high heat of a pot coming straight off the burner can burn or scald your laminate, leaving an unsightly mark.

Repairing a cut, chip or burn on laminate is not an easy fix. In some cases, you may have to replace the entire countertop or live with the unwanted blemish. But if you follow simple precautions, all you need to do is clean your laminate surface with mild soap, and you’ll have a countertop that will look good for years.
