  That proverbial “cold Kentucky rain keeps pouring down,” as the song says, keeping the Bluegrass State’s eponymous _Poa pratensis_ looking lush and green. Unfortunately for Kentucky homeowners who neglect their water heaters, that hot morning shower that gets you ready to face your day could suddenly _feel_ like “cold Kentucky rain” and send goosebumps down your entire body. Well, when it comes to water heater repair and replacement costs, consider yourself lucky, Kentucky: Across the board, the average Kentucker pays less than their fellow American homeowner.

Your water heater powers your dishwasher, clothes washer and the hot shower you crave at the end of the day. When it goes kaput, it's not so much a matter of _whether_ you should have it serviced, but how much that service will cost. And if your hot water is already out, the last thing you want right now is to be blindsided by exorbitant water heater service fees. If you’re calling around for estimates, these figures should give you a ballpark idea of how much you can expect to pay, from the Ohio River to the Cumberland Plateau.

Repair and replacement costs vary depending on where you live. For comparison, the national average for diagnosis is $99, for repair is $493 and for replacement is $1,741.

The following average prices are based on aggregated HomeServe data reported by our network of contractors across the state of Kentucky.

Water Heater Diagnosis: $88
---------------------------

The diagnostic fee is what the technician will charge you to come out to your home, inspect your system and tell you whether it needs to be repaired or replaced. In Kentucky, this fee is about 11% lower than the national average.

Water Heater Repair: $310
-------------------------

Any of a number of things may be going wrong with your water heater — issues with the gas control valve, a faulty thermostat or a combination of several malfunctions. This average repair price includes replacement parts and the labor to install them. Repairs cost Kentuckians an average of 37% less than the U.S. overall.

Water Heater Replace: $1,345
----------------------------

Water heaters only last about 10 years, so a breakdown might be a sign that yours is on its way out. At the end of your water heater’s useful life, you'll need to spring for a new one. Kentucky’s average replacement price is nearly 23% lower than the nation’s.

(Note that HomeServe water heater data should generally be assumed to refer to conventional “tanked” models — the most common type — as opposed to tankless or “on-demand” models, which can cost roughly twice as much.)
