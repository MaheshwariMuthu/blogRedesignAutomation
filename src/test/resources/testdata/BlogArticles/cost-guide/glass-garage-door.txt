If you're looking into a glass garage door for your house, you may want to clear up questions on cost. We’ve got you covered.

Why Install a Glass Garage Door?
--------------------------------

Homeowners have their choice of many types of materials for garage doors, but aluminum and glass doors are excellent choices for modern house designs. Installing a glass garage door is one of the easiest ways to add a unique visual flair to your home.

Glass doors let in lots of natural light, making the space lighter, warmer and more welcoming. They're also very sturdy, as they're typically made of tempered glass that's as strong as aluminum and wood. Glass garage doors generally don't need painting, since you only need to clean the glass using a soft, clean cloth or glass cleaner.

Glass garage doors come in different types and styles, with these variations affecting the total cost. The cost of installing the garage door also varies depending on whether it's a residential or a commercial glass garage door. Residential glass garage doors are generally more affordable and come in a range of colors, styles and glass types.

Glass Garage Door Cost
----------------------

Typically, the cost depends on the type of glass garage doors and the size. According to [Fixr](https://www.fixr.com/costs/install-garage-door#new-garage-door-cost-by-material), you can expect to pay an average of $900 to $4,500 (CAD 1,100 to CAD 5,800) for a new glass garage door. The thickness of the glass panels is one of the most important factors impacting cost. Thick glass panels are stronger and harder to break.

Glass garage doors are generally low-maintenance and made of safe tempered glass. On the downside, they can be heavier, which makes installation challenging. They’re also more expensive than other common garage door materials like fiberglass, wood and steel.

### Insulated Glass Garage Door Cost

Insulated glass garage doors significantly increase a home's energy efficiency, although they're comparable to insulated wood or steel garage doors. You can expect to pay [significantly more](https://www.familyhandyman.com/article/glass-garage-doors/#are-glass-garage-doors-insulated) if you choose to install an insulated glass garage door rather than a tempered glass garage door.

### Frosted Glass Garage Door Cost

For a frosted glass garage door, you may pay around $350 (CAD 450) more than for a tempered glass garage door. The labor costs for installing either type are about the same.

### Glass Rollup Doors

These glass garage doors have been gaining popularity in recent years as a replacement for main walls or windows that merge outdoor and indoor spaces. They can be insulated for better climate control and greater energy savings, and are most common in restaurants, wineries and breweries. When you open a rollup door, the outdoor and indoor spaces merge with one another, inviting foot traffic. Once the door is closed, the indoor space is insulated and shielded from weather while still offering a view of the outside milieu.

### Average Cost of a Glass Garage Door by Style

Glass garage doors come in a range of eye-catching styles. When purchasing a glass door, it's important to consider the features and benefits each type offers. But the bottom line is to choose one that reflects your taste preferences. Here are some of the common glass garage door styles and their respective average costs:

* **French garage doors:** $3,500 (CAD 4,500)
* **Carriage garage doors:** $2,000 (CAD 2,600)
* **Paneled garage doors:** $1,500 (CAD 1,900)

### Garage Door Price by Configuration

The size of the garage door affects the overall cost of your installation. For instance, if your garage holds more than one vehicle, you can configure it to have two or more separate doors. Alternatively, you can install one wide double door to cover the entire gap.

Other Considerations
--------------------

Before purchasing the glass garage door, you should also consider other necessary accessories, such as garage-door openers. Most door openers cost $150 to $500 (CAD 195 to CAD 650), and you can expect to pay between [$65 and $85](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/home-improvement/garage-door-opener-installation-cost/) (CAD 85 to CAD 110) per hour for installation. Some of the more advanced models include Wi-Fi capability, LED lighting, built-in safety features and battery backup to ensure they're fully functional even during power outages.

### Labor Costs to Install a Glass Garage Door

When purchasing a glass garage door, you should also consider the cost of labor. Fortunately, most installers charge a flat rate for the service. You can expect to pay $220 (CAD 285) to install a single door and about $400 (CAD 515) for a double garage door. If the door is custom-built, you can expect the installation cost to be higher.

Glass Garage Door Repair Cost
-----------------------------

You may not need to replace the entire garage door to install glass panels. Typically, the cost of repairing a glass garage door is lower than installing an entirely new one.

Most problems associated with garage doors arise from their torsion, springs and openers — in which case, you can expect to pay between [$85 and $290](https://homeguide.com/costs/garage-door-repair-cost) (CAD 110 and CAD 375) for the repairs. But if the door has cracks or broken sections, you may need to replace it. Only repair the door if it's in perfect structural condition but not operational.

Enhancements and Upgrades
-------------------------

You can also opt for a few enhancements to your glass garage door. For example, you can choose to resize the door or combine two separate doors into a double glass garage door. The cost of this ranges from $500 to $2,000 (CAD 650 to CAD 1,300), depending on the project's scope. You can also add extra windows to the door for aesthetic appeal or to let in more natural light.
