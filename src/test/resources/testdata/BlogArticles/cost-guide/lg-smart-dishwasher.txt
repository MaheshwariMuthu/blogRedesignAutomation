LG is one of the best-known manufacturers making smart dishwashers and other Wi-Fi-enabled appliances. Here’s how much LG smart dishwashers cost and what features you get for the price.

How Much Does an LG Smart Dishwasher Cost?
------------------------------------------

As of 2023, LG sells 16 different models of smart dishwashers through its website. LG smart dishwashers cost [between $679 and $1,899](https://www.lg.com/us/dishwashers) (CAD 907 and CAD 2,537), depending on the size and features of your chosen model. The company also provides free shipping to the contiguous United States.

LG offers monthly installment plans or payment in four installments through Klarna, a third-party financing company. However, you'll need to meet certain eligibility criteria to purchase an LG smart dishwasher with financing options. You'll also want to consider the cost of installation and taking out an existing dishwasher, if applicable.

LG Smart Dishwasher Models: Finishes and Features
-------------------------------------------------

LG makes dishwashers in four finishes:

*   Black stainless steel
*   Stainless steel
*   Smooth black
*   White

However, not all dishwashers are available in every color option. The range also offers a mix of front- and top-control models.

All LG smart dishwashers are [Energy Star-rated](https://www.energystar.gov/) and connect to the [ThinQ app](https://www.lg.com/us/discover/thinq/kitchen) on your smartphone or another handheld device via Wi-Fi. This feature allows you to control your LG dishwasher remotely to schedule cycles. The app also provides regular performance reports and maintenance advice, and it can even diagnose potential problems with your dishwasher before they turn into bigger issues.

Most LG smart dishwashers can accommodate either 14 or 15 place settings. However, which features you get varies based on the model. Generally, the most expensive models incorporate most or all of LG's advanced dishwasher features, while the more affordable options may not offer the full range of benefits. Available features include:

* **QuadWash:** Four spraying arms direct water jets at your dishes from multiple angles to ensure more efficient cleaning.
* **TrueSteam Technology:** Advanced steam technology kills up to 99.999% of bacteria, loosens stubborn food residue and prevents water marks.
* **Adjustable Third Rack:** An extra rack lets you configure the inside of your dishwasher to accommodate large or awkwardly shaped utensils and fit more inside.

Cost Comparison Between Regular and Smart LG Dishwashers
--------------------------------------------------------

LG dishwashers with integrated Wi-Fi are significantly more expensive than models without smart features. For example, the most affordable regular LG dishwasher with QuadWash technology costs $[549](https://www.lg.com/us/dishwashers/lg-ldb4548st-top-control-dishwasher) (CAD 733). A smart dishwasher with comparable features costs $[679](https://www.lg.com/us/dishwashers/lg-adfd5448at-front-control-dishwasher) (CAD 907). Therefore, it's worth carefully considering how important smart features are to you before shelling out on a pricier LG smart dishwasher. If you're looking for the absolute cheapest dishwasher, a countertop model is usually your best bet.
