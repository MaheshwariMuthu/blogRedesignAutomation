“Elegance” sounds expensive — but it doesn’t have to be. Before you rush into this project, determine what type of crown molding is best for your space and what you’ll have to pay for installation.

What Is Crown Molding?
----------------------

The term “crown molding” denotes a specific shape. The molding is shaped at an angle so it can sit snugly between a ceiling and wall to cover gaps and seams. There are a variety of styles and widths available to fit the size of the room and look you want to achieve.

Can I Install My Own Crown Molding?
-----------------------------------

Plastic crown molding is suitable for homeowners who want to cut and install pieces of molding themselves. You need a few tools, such as a miter saw, tape measurer, nail gun, caulk gun and pencil.

Start by measuring the length of the walls to determine how much material you need for each section. The ends of the molding should be cut at an angle so they fit precisely together. Cut the pieces to size and place them along the wall to ensure everything fits properly together. Then, nail the pieces into place along the wall and ceiling.

Other types of molding materials, such as wood and plaster, aren’t as easy to work with as plastic and should be installed by professionals.

How Much Does DIY Crown Molding Cost?
-------------------------------------

Plastic crown molding is made out of PVC, polyurethane and polyethylene. These materials are very suitable for high-moisture environments like bathrooms, where wood doesn’t hold up as well as plastic does. Plastic crown molding is also the least expensive at $2 to $4 (CAD 2.50 to CAD 5) per linear foot.

What Do Different Types of Crown Molding Cost?
----------------------------------------------

You can choose various materials to create the look you want. Those choices do impact price.

### Wood Molding

Paint-grade pine starts out at $1 (CAD 1.25) per linear foot. This goes up if you want to use woods like oak and walnut, which can be stained. Intricately milled custom molding can cost as much as $30 (CAD 38) per linear foot.

### MDF Molding

MDF (medium-density fiberboard) is a product of sawdust and resin pressed together to form detailed crowns. The material produces a soft surface that can be easily dented or scratched and typically needs to be painted. The cost for MDF crowns typically runs from $1 to $7 (CAD 1.25 to CAD 9) per linear foot.

### Plaster Crown Molding

This is the top-of-the-line crown molding and is used in large rooms and entryways. This molding is designed to capture your attention as you step into a room. However, you usually have to order this type of trim from a traditional lumber yard as it isn’t often sold in DIY stores. The cost can reach upward of $30 (CAD 38) per linear foot. The plaster material typically requires professional installation unless you have superior carpentry skills.

How Much Does It Cost to Hire a Professional?
---------------------------------------------

Crown molding can add appealing architectural details to a room, provided the right types and styles are used. A professional installer can help you choose the right options for your space.

Carpenters’ rates vary depending on where you live, but you can expect to pay roughly $8 to $12 (CAD 10 to CAD 15) per linear foot, or up to $500 (CAD 630) for a 10-foot by 10-foot room.
