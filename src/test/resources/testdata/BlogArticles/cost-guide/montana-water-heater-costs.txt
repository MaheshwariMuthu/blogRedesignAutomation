  Not to generalize, but many Montanans are outdoorsy types. And it’s no wonder; with Yellowstone and Glacier National Park right in your backyard, who _wouldn’t_ be into camping and hiking? After a day out in Big Sky Country, the first thing you want when you get home is a hot shower — but you can’t do that if your water heater’s on the fritz. Good news for you: It costs less to fix or replace your water heater in Montana than the U.S. at large.

Your water heater powers your dishwasher, clothes washer and the hot shower you crave at the end of the day. When it goes kaput, it's not so much a matter of _whether_ you should have it serviced, but how much that service will cost. And if your hot water is already out, the last thing you want right now is to be blindsided by exorbitant water heater service fees. If you’re calling around for estimates, these figures should give you a ballpark idea of how much you can expect to pay in the from Billings to Missoula.

Repair and replacement costs vary depending on where you live. For comparison, the national average for diagnosis is $99, for repair is $493 and for replacement is $1,741.

The following average prices are based on aggregated HomeServe data reported by our network of contractors across the state of Montana:

Water Heater Diagnosis: $94
---------------------------

After you call the technician, they’ll come out, diagnose what’s wrong with your system and determine whether it needs to be repaired or replaced. Usually, there’s a charge for this. In the Treasure State, the diagnostic fee is about 5% lower than the national average.

Water Heater Repair: $310
-------------------------

Any of a number of things may be going wrong with your water heater — issues with the gas control valve, a faulty thermostat or a combination of several malfunctions. This average repair price includes replacement parts and the labor to install them. Repairs cost Montanans an average of 37% less than they do the U.S. overall.

Water Heater Replace: $1,579
----------------------------

Did you know most water heaters only last about 10 years? If yours has passed the decade mark, a breakdown might signify that it needs to be replaced. Montana’s average replacement price is about 9% less than the nation’s.

(Note that HomeServe water heater data should generally be assumed to refer to conventional “tanked” models — the most common type — as opposed to tankless or “on-demand” models, which can cost roughly twice as much.)
