How Much Are Gazebos?
---------------------

The average homeowner spends between about $5,400 and $9,100 CAD 7,200 and CAD 12,200) on a gazebo, according to [LawnStarter](https://www.lawnstarter.com/blog/cost/gazebo-price/#24-diy-vs-hiring-a-professional). The cost to build a gazebo will depend on how big it is, what it's made of and whether you need to do any work on your yard or garden in order to accommodate the gazebo itself. The quality of materials used to build a gazebo can vary dramatically. Low-cost vinyl gazebos are easy to erect but may fade or become damaged over time. Wrought iron or hardwood products will last much longer but also cost much more up front.

How Much Does a 12x12 Gazebo Cost?
----------------------------------

The cost to build a gazebo varies depending on the materials it's made from. You can expect to pay between $7,150 and $11,200 (CAD 9,600 and CAD 15,000) for a 12-foot by 12-foot gazebo. If you want a custom gazebo, that will cost more than a simple vinyl one. High-quality wood or wrought iron constructions are also usually more expensive.

Does a Gazebo Add Value to Your Home?
-------------------------------------

Building a gazebo may increase the value of your home, but how much value it will add depends on a variety of factors, including the gazebo cost, as well as the value of your home compared to other similar properties in the local area.

Valuing houses is complex. More features don’t always translate to a higher value. You could have a pristine home with a pool in the yard, but if the other houses in the area are undesirable, there'll be a cap on the value of your home just because buyers are usually unwilling to pay more in an area where property values are low.

Adding a gazebo to your property could add curb appeal and help it sell more quickly. You'll also get some enjoyment out of it while you're living there, potentially making it a good investment for that reason alone.
