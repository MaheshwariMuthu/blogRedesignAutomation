  The jig is up, Utahns: We know you’re sluffing class or calling in sick to take a powder day and head up to the slopes. But we don’t blame you; you do have the [greatest snow on earth](https://www.abc4.com/news/digital-exclusives/why-is-utah-known-for-having-the-greatest-snow-on-earth/), after all. After, you come home to ease those sore muscles with a hot shower, when — _heck!_ — the water heater’s gone out. What now? Well, you should know that, on average, it actually costs less to service your water heater in Utah than in the U.S. at large.

Your water heater powers your dishwasher, clothes washer and the hot shower you crave at the end of the day. When it goes kaput, it's not so much a matter of _whether_ you should have it serviced, but how much that service will cost. And if your hot water is already out, the last thing you want right now is to be blindsided by exorbitant water heater service fees. If you’re calling around for estimates, these figures should give you a ballpark idea of how much you can expect to pay in the Beehive State.

Repair and replacement costs vary depending on where you live. For comparison, the national average for diagnosis is $99, for repair is $493 and for replacement is $1,741.

The following average prices are based on aggregated HomeServe data reported by our network of contractors across the state of Utah.

Water Heater Diagnosis: $76
---------------------------

The diagnostic fee is what the technician will charge you to tell you what’s wrong with your system and whether it needs to be repaired or replaced. In Utah, this fee is about 23% lower than the national average.

Water Heater Repair: $360
-------------------------

After your technician tells you what’s wrong with your system, they may need to do some repair work. This usually involves ordering new parts to replace a worn-out heating element, faulty thermostat or another malfunctioning component. This average repair price includes replacement parts and the labor to install them. Repairs cost Utahns an average of 27% less than the U.S. overall.

Water Heater Replace: $1,590
----------------------------

Water heaters don’t last forever, and a breakdown might be a sign that yours is on its way out. At the end of your water heater’s useful life (about 10 years), you'll need to spring for a new one. Utah’s average replacement price is about 9% less than the nation’s.

(Note that HomeServe water heater data should generally be assumed to refer to conventional “tanked” models — the most common type — as opposed to tankless or “on-demand” models, which can cost roughly twice as much.)
