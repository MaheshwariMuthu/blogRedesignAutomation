If you're looking to replace your shower and upgrade your experience, there are a few things you need to be aware of so you can stay within your budget. Here's what you need to consider before you start the shower installation process.

How Much Does a Brand-New Shower Cost?
--------------------------------------

You've got a few choices based on how much space you have and what kind of budget you have to cover the replacement cost. According to [HomeGuide](https://homeguide.com/costs/shower-installation-cost), on average, you can expect to pay somewhere between $2,000 and $9,000 (CAD 2,600 and CAD 11,600) for the entire cost of putting in a brand-new shower, with your cost varying based on what kind of shower you decide to install.

How Much Do Different Kinds of Showers Cost?
--------------------------------------------

If you don't have a lot of space available, a prefab shower might be your best bet. These options cost between $1,000 and $8,000 (CAD 1,300 and CAD 10,300) to install, and as long as you've got the space to fit them through the door, they are a great way to upgrade your bathroom with a private shower stall.

If you care about customization to your preferences, however, a walk-in tile shower may be your best bet. These showers are completely customizable because ceramic tiles can be made in any size and color. However, your total cost doesn't stop with the shower itself when you go down this route; the maintenance costs on a tile shower can be quite high. A walk-in tile shower can run you $15,000 (CAD 19,000), _and_ you'll need to keep paying down the road for maintenance.

If you don't have the budget to create a brand-new shower, a tub shower combination can be a fine solution. This is the cheapest option on the market, as you can get a high-end combination for $4,000 (CAD 5,100) and can enter the market for $1,000 (CAD 1,300) or less. As long as you're fine with not having a shower door in place, this can be a reasonable option for the bathroom.

You can also use this option as a back door to get a walk-in shower down the road, because a bathtub can be converted to a shower after it's been installed. According to [Bob Vila](https://www.bobvila.com/articles/walk-in-showers/), this could end up costing as much as a walk-in tile shower, as you can expect to pay between $2,000 and $12,000 (CAD 2,600 and CAD 15,500) to convert an existing bathtub to a shower. However, you'll be able to pay for the original installation now and the conversion after you've had time to save.

How Much Does It Cost to Hire a Plumber?
----------------------------------------

One thing many homeowners forget in planning for the cost of installing a shower is that plumbing isn't part of the remodeling process. When you add a shower to your bathroom, your cost might include things like a new shower liner, adding a glass door and the cost to convert a bathtub to a walk-in shower, but it won't include making sure the new shower connects to your plumbing.

To take care of that, you'll need to hire an expert plumber and have them work with your shower installation team to ensure that everything is operational when the job is complete. [HomeGuide](https://homeguide.com/costs/shower-installation-cost) says you can expect to pay somewhere between $850 and $1,200 (CAD 1,100 and CAD 1,550) to get everything connected properly. Before you start the process of putting a shower in place, it's important to take care of this important step.<br><iframe title="YouTube video player" width="1072" height="603" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pM2NlhbKBH0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen title="How to Drain A Water Heater | Hot Water Tank Tips"></iframe>
