Over time, rips in the liner or split seams can cause a liner to leak, which could lead to serious issues unless you repair or replace it. We've got everything you need to know about pool liner replacement and repair costs.

How Much Does Pool Liner Replacement Cost on Average?
-----------------------------------------------------

According to [HomeGuide](https://homeguide.com/costs/pool-liner-cost#vs), a vinyl pool liner replacement costs around $1,180 (CAD 1,500) on average. Most people will pay between $835 and $2,890 (CAD 1,060 and CAD 3,700). However, you could pay as little as $250 (CAD 315) to replace a pool liner in a small, above-ground pool. Meanwhile, pool liner replacement for a large pool using premium materials could cost as much as $4,500 (CAD 5,700).

What Factors Affect Pool Liner Replacement Costs?
-------------------------------------------------

The primary factor affecting the cost of a pool liner replacement is whether you have an inground or above-ground swimming pool. An inground pool liner is more expensive to purchase and install, costing between $400 and $2,300 (CAD 500 and CAD 2900) on average. Meanwhile, replacing an above-ground pool liner typically costs between $150 and $800 (CAD 190 and CAD 1,015).

The size and layout of your pool also make a difference in how much you pay to replace the pool liner. The larger the pool, the more you'll pay. Furthermore, custom-shaped pools or those with added features like integrated steps require a custom liner. Custom-made liners are often considerably more expensive than standard designs.

The thickness of your new pool liner affects the price, too. A thick pool liner will cost more, but it could also last longer. You'll also pay a premium for decorative liners with tiled or swirled effects.

Finally, consider the closure type if you have an above-ground pool. Unibead and J-Hook closures are longer-lasting than overlap closures, but they are also more expensive.

How Much Does It Cost to Repair a Pool Liner?
---------------------------------------------

You'll almost always need to replace your pool liner if it sustains major damage. However, a professional technician may be able to repair small tears or leaks in the liner without replacing it entirely.

The cost to repair a pool liner varies widely depending on the type and extent of the damage, but you should expect to pay [between $500 and $1,000](https://www.kompareit.com/homeandgarden/pools-cost-to-replace-pool-liner.html) (CAD 630 and CAD 1,270) to fix a small leak. Although the repair itself is generally inexpensive, it can take contractors considerable time and effort to assess the extent of the issue. Therefore, the majority of the cost of repairing a pool liner is labor fees.

How Often Do You Need to Replace a Pool Liner?
----------------------------------------------

According to [River Pools and Spas](https://www.riverpoolsandspas.com/blog/how-long-will-pool-vinyl-liner-last), you can expect an inground pool liner to last between five and nine years. Meanwhile, an above-ground pool liner has an expected lifespan between six and 10 years.

However, it's possible that your pool liner could last significantly longer with regular maintenance. Proper installation and maintaining the correct balance of chemicals in the water can also improve your pool liner's lifespan.

Many homeowners are surprised by the difference between their pool liner's projected lifespan and the warranty length. Pool liners often come with warranties of 25 to 30 years or longer. However, manufacturers typically prorate their warranties heavily, which means that you'll only receive a small fraction of the replacement cost after a few years of non-prorated coverage.
