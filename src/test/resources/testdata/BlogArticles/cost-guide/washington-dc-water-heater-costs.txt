  As the seat of American democracy, the District of Columbia is the heart of the proverbial Free World — but when it comes to water heater maintenance, even in D.C., forget about free. Yes, the right to a hot shower carries costs on Capitol Hill, too. That said, as you budget for eventual water heater repairs or replacement, Washington, D.C., denizens may be relieved to know that they pay less on average than their fellow Americans.

Your water heater powers your dishwasher, clothes washer and the hot shower you crave at the end of the day. When it goes kaput, it's not so much a matter of _whether_ you should have it serviced, but how much that service will cost. And if your hot water is already out, the last thing you want right now is to be blindsided by exorbitant water heater service fees. If you’re calling around for estimates, these figures should give you a ballpark idea of how much you can expect to pay inside the Beltway.

Repair and replacement costs vary depending on where you live. For comparison, the national average for diagnosis is $99, for repair is $493 and for replacement is $1,741.

The following average prices are based on aggregated HomeServe data reported by our network of contractors across the District of Columbia:

Water Heater Diagnosis: $87
---------------------------

The technician will charge you a fee to come out to your home, tell you what’s wrong with your system and determine whether it needs to be repaired or replaced. For Washingtonians at large‚ this fee is 12% less than the national average.

Water Heater Repair: $398
-------------------------

Any number of things may be going wrong with your water heater — issues with the gas control valve, a faulty thermostat or a combination of several malfunctions. This estimated repair price includes replacement parts and the labor to install them. Water heater repairs cost the average D.C. homeowner roughly 19% less than they do nationwide.

Water Heater Replace: $1,468
----------------------------

Water heaters don’t last forever, and a breakdown might be a sign that yours is on its way out. At the end of your water heater’s usable life (about 10 years), you'll need to spring for a new one. D.C.’s average replacement price is 16% less than that of the nation.

(Note that HomeServe water heater data should generally be assumed to refer to conventional “tanked” models — the most common type — as opposed to tankless or “on-demand” models, which can cost roughly twice as much.)
