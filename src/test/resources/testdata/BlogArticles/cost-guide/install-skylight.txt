However, it's essential to understand the financial implications before committing to a project like this.

How Much Does Skylight Installation Cost Where You Don't Already Have One?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

According to [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/home-improvement/windows/cost-to-install-skylight/), skylight installation costs an average of $1,750 (CAD 2,322), with most homeowners spending between $1,000 and $2,500 (CAD 1,327 and CAD 3,317). The larger the skylight, the more you'll pay. For example, a small 25-inch-by-41-inch skylight typically costs between $325 and $650 (CAD 431 and CAD 863). Meanwhile, a 49-inch-by-49-inch model costs $550 to $2,200 (CAD 730 to CAD 2,191).

How Much Does It Cost to Replace an Existing Skylight?
------------------------------------------------------

Replacing a skylight is slightly cheaper than installing a brand-new unit. [HomeGuide](https://homeguide.com/costs/skylight-replacement-or-repair-cost) says it costs $800 to $2,400 (CAD 1,062 to CAD 3,185). However, you may not need a full replacement. If your skylight is generally in good condition, you can save money by replacing the faulty part.

Replacing the glass in a skylight window costs between $150 and $600 (CAD 199 and CAD 796), but you may need to replace the entire unit if the glass is inaccessible. Expect to pay between $350 and $700 (CAD 464 and CAD 929) to replace a broken skylight motor.

Repairing a faulty skylight is usually the most cost-effective option. Most homeowners pay between $150 and $800 (CAD 199 and CAD 1,060) for skylight repairs. Common skylight repair projects include resealing, fixing leaks, repairing the weatherstripping and repairing the frame.

What Factors Affect the Cost of Skylight Installation?
------------------------------------------------------

The size of your skylight has the most significant influence on your project costs. However, several other factors can impact how much you'll pay for the unit itself and installation labor. Understanding how these factors affect the price can help you choose the most cost-effective option for your budget.

### Shape

Circular skylights are the most affordable option, with most homeowners spending between $400 and $1,000 (CAD 531 and CAD 1,327). Rectangular skylights work in most spaces and usually cost between $175 and $2,225 (CAD 232 and CAD 2,952). Pyramid skylights are the most expensive units at $550 to $3,500 (CAD 730 to CAD 4,644) per window.

### Material

Your choice of framing material can also impact the cost of installing skylights. The national average cost to install a vinyl-framed skylight is $175 to $1,225 (CAD 232 to CAD 1,626), while metal-framed models cost $225 to $1,600 (CAD 299 to CAD 2,123). Wooden frames are the costliest at $350 to $2,750 (CAD 464 to CAD 3,649) per unit.

### Type

Fixed skylights typically cost between $175 and $1,600 (CAD 232 and CAD 2,123). Tubular skylights are also relatively budget-friendly at $500 to $950 (CAD 663 to CAD 1,261) per unit. Generally, ventilating skylights are more expensive at $2,000 to $3,500 (CAD 2,654 to CAD 4,644).
