To put it in kitchenware terms: While Florida’s burners stay lit under Miami all year long, even the Panhandle stays pretty warm all year-round. But the Sunshine State benefits from its generally warm subtropical climate beyond spring-break business up in Panama City and #ThatEndlessSummerLife down in the Keys. Florida homeowners also enjoy significantly cheaper repair and replacement prices for residential [water service lines](https://www.homeserve.com/en-us/blog/home-improvement/exterior-water-service-lines-explained/) courtesy of the climate. Dig this: All that warm weather means pipes needn’t be buried as deep as they are elsewhere, meaning service technicians don’t have to dig down as deep in the ground to get to them, saving time, labor and cash compared with the average water line job across the U.S.

Your exterior water service line carries water from the public water main into your home. But make no mistake: Once the pipes run under your property, they’re _your_ responsibility — so you’re likely on the hook for any repair or replacement costs.

How deep your pipes are buried deeply impacts the price you pay for these services. Water service lines are buried as deep as local building codes require — but usually, the depth is determined by the frost line in your area. And the deeper the technician must dig to get to your broken or otherwise compromised line, the higher the cost.

The nationwide average water service line depth is 4.58 feet, but in Florida, water lines are roughly half that, at 2.53 feet. For further context, in _f-f-f-freezing_ Minnesota, pipe depth is more than _8_ feet.

Repair and replacement costs also vary depending on where you live. The national average for diagnosis is $222, for repair is $1,039 and for replacement is $3,581.

Below, you’ll find average service prices based on aggregated HomeServe data reported by our network of contractors across Florida, which should give you an approximation of how much you’ll pay to fix your out-of-commission water service line.

Water Service Line Diagnosis: $179
----------------------------------

Before any work can begin, the technician will need to come out and run some tests to see what’s wrong with your system. In Florida, the fee for this is 19% lower than the national average.

Water Service Line Repair: $742
-------------------------------

A whole host of things can cause trouble with your exterior water service line — from invading tree roots to clogs to general wear and tear. Whatever’s up with your system, the repair process will likely start with excavation to expose the pipe. Depending on your situation, the technician may need to clear a blockage, find a leak or fix the pipe — and, of course, fill the hole back in.

Florida’s average repair price is about 24% less than the nation’s.

Water Service Line Replace: $2,731
----------------------------------

Small sections of leaky or broken pipe can be repaired, but massive clogs or fully compromised pipes might necessitate a full replacement. Water service line replacements cost Floridians 30% less than the average American.
