  There's nothing quite as relaxing as a dip in the pool on a hot day. However, figuring out how to fill your swimming pool can be a real headache. While a garden hose can be a convenient (and cheap) solution for filling a jacuzzi or small plunge pool, it's an extremely long-winded way to fill a larger backyard pool.

Enter the pool water delivery service. Professional companies can fill a swimming pool quickly, making them an ideal option when you want to use your pool as soon as possible. However, speed and convenience come at a cost.

How Much Do Pool Water Delivery Services Charge?
------------------------------------------------

According to [HomeGuide](https://homeguide.com/costs/pool-water-delivery-cost#who), most pool water delivery companies charge by the truckload. Typically, a delivery truck contains around 6,000 gallons of water and costs between $200 and $600 (CAD 266 and CAD 797).

However, costs can vary significantly by area. For example, a truckload of pool water may cost between $200 and $500 (CAD 266 and CAD 664) in the Southwest, while you could pay between $350 and $600 (CAD 465 and CAD 797) in the Midwest. Prices typically include labor and delivery. You could pay significantly more if you live in a remote, rural area because the company has to travel further to reach your home.

How Much Do They Charge to Fill a Pool?
---------------------------------------

The cost to fill a pool depends on how much water you need. Most homeowners pay between $400 and $2,400 (CAD 531 and CAD 3188) to fill a 10,000- to 20,000-gallon swimming pool. At the lower end of the scale, filling a 3,000-gallon 12-inch round pool could cost as little as $200 to $600 (CAD 266 to CAD 797).

On average, filling a pool costs between 3 and 10 cents (CAD 0.04 and CAD 0.13) per gallon. However, you may pay for more water than you actually need if you require less than a truckload to fill a smaller pool. In this situation, you could ask your delivery company if they deliver partial loads or look for a company selling pool water by the gallon.

How Much Does 1,000 Gallons of Pool Water Cost?
-----------------------------------------------

On average, 1,000 gallons of pool water costs between $30 and $100 (CAD 40 and CAD 133). However, you may struggle to find a company willing to deliver such a small amount of water.

In this situation, it's usually cheaper to fill your swimming pool yourself using a garden hose. Filling a pool yourself generally costs $4 to $10 (CAD 5 to CAD 13) per 1,000 gallons for city water supply users. You'll spend significantly less if you have a water well, as you'll only pay for the electricity to run the pump. However, filling your pool with a hose could take 12 hours or more, compared to under an hour if you hire a delivery company.

How Much Does 10,000 Gallons of Pool Water Cost?
------------------------------------------------

Filling a pool with 10,000 gallons of water usually costs between $300 and $1,000 (CAD 398 and CAD 1,328) and is enough to fill a 21-foot round pool or a 12-foot by 24-foot rectangular pool.<br><iframe title="YouTube video player" width="1072" height="603" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ut21k0-1KZQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen title="Water Line Repair and Replacement | What You Can Expect to Pay"></iframe>
