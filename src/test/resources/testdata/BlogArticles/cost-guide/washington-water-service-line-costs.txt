The constant drizzle has subsided, and the mountains have come out: What could possibly ruin such a nice day in the Pacific Northwest? Perhaps something ... underground. No, we’re not talking about [“The Big One”](https://www.koin.com/news/environment/earthquakes/its-been-321-years-since-the-big-one-hit-pnw/) — we mean your [water service line](https://www.homeserve.com/en-us/blog/home-improvement/exterior-water-service-lines-explained/). If it’s damaged, this pipe can cause all sorts of issues. In Washington State, you’ll find that average water service line repair and replacement costs are right around the national average.

Your exterior water service line carries water from the public water main into your home. But make no mistake: Once the pipes run under your property, they’re _your_ responsibility — so you’re likely on the hook for any repair or replacement costs.

How deep your pipes are buried deeply impacts the price you pay for these services. Water service lines are buried as deep as local building codes require — but usually, the depth is determined by the frost line in your area. And the deeper the technician must dig to get to your broken or otherwise compromised line, the higher the cost.

The nationwide average water service line depth is 4.58 feet, but in Washington, these lines aren’t buried as deep — only 3.18 feet on average. For context, in _f-f-f-freezing_ Minnesota, pipe depth is more than _8_ feet.

Repair and replacement costs also vary depending on where you live. The national average for diagnosis is $222, for repair is $1,039 and for replacement is $3,581.

Below, you’ll find average service prices based on aggregated HomeServe data reported by our network of contractors across the state of Washington, which should give you an approximation of how much you’ll pay to fix your out-of-commission water service line.

Water Service Line Diagnosis: $243
----------------------------------

Before any work can begin, the technician will need to come out and run some tests to see what’s wrong with your system. In the Evergreen State, the fee for this is 9% higher than the national average.

Water Service Line Repair: $968
-------------------------------

A whole host of things can cause trouble with your exterior water service line — from invading tree roots to clogs to general wear and tear. Whatever’s up with your system, the repair process will likely start with excavation to expose the pipe. Depending on your situation, the technician may need to clear a blockage, find a leak or fix the pipe — and, of course, fill the hole back in.

Washington’s average repair price is about 7% lower than the nation’s.

Water Service Line Replace: $3,530
----------------------------------

Small sections of leaky or broken pipe can be repaired, but massive clogs or fully compromised pipes might necessitate a full replacement. Water service line replacements cost Washingtonians about 50 bucks less than the average American.
