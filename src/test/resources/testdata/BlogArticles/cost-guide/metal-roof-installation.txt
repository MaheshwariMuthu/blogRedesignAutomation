  Replacing your roof can be inconvenient and expensive, so it's hardly surprising that durability is one of the most important deciding factors for many homeowners. Metal roofing systems are gaining popularity thanks to their stylish appearance and long lifespans. However, metal is also one of the most expensive roofing options, so it's important to understand the costs involved before replacing your existing roof with a metal one.

So, how much does a metal roof cost? The information below will help you understand the material and labor costs for metal roof installation and explain how they compare to the cost of installing a regular asphalt shingle roof.

What Is the Labor Cost for Installing a Metal Roof?
---------------------------------------------------

Labor costs and other contractor costs (like equipment hire) account for roughly two-thirds of the total price of installing a metal roof. According to data from Forbes, you should expect to pay between $2 and $14 (CAD 2.67 and CAD 19) per square foot for metal roof installation, according to data from [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/home-improvement/roofing/metal-roof-cost/).

There are a couple of factors that could make your metal roof installation costs higher. If you have multiple chimneys or other roof features that make the roof more difficult to build, you should expect to pay more. It’s also more expensive to install a high-pitch metal roof. A seam roof is more difficult to install. [HomeGuide](https://homeguide.com/costs/metal-roof-cost) says it typically costs between $9 and $16 (CAD 12 and CAD 21) per square foot.

How Much Do Materials Cost for a Metal Roof?
--------------------------------------------

The cost of metal roofing materials varies widely depending on which type of metal and finish you want. At the cheapest end of the scale, galvalume steel roofing sheets cost between $4 and $9 (CAD 5.35 and CAD 12) per square foot, according to [This Old House](https://www.thisoldhouse.com/roofing/reviews/metal-roofing-cost). Premium copper sheets could set you back between $20 and $40 (CAD 27 and CAD 53) per square foot.

A mid-range roof material such as aluminum costs between roughly $6.50 and $21 (CAD 8.69 and CAD 28) per square foot. For an average-sized roof measuring 1,500 square feet, this adds up to a total average material cost of between $9,750 and $31,500 (CAD 13,037 and CAD 42,119).

How Much Does It Cost to Put a Metal Roof on a 2,000-Square-Foot House?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

According to [HomeGuide](https://homeguide.com/costs/metal-roof-cost), a 2,000-square foot metal roof costs between $10,000 and $32,000 (CAD 13,371 and CAD 42,787), including the cost of materials and installation labor. Although this price range is very wide, your project probably won’t come in towards the upper end of that scale unless you select a pricey material like copper.

However, bear in mind that your roof area will be larger than your home’s footprint unless you have a flat roof. The roof’s pitch angle will affect the overall square footage — the higher the pitch, the greater the roof area.

Is It Cheaper to Install a Metal Roof or a Shingle Roof?
--------------------------------------------------------

Generally, a metal roof costs more than a shingle one. Compared to the figures above, a 2,000-square-foot asphalt shingle roof comes in at about $6,000 to $10,500 (CAD 8,023 to CAD 13,371) installed, according to [HomeGuide](https://homeguide.com/costs/asphalt-shingle-roof-cost).

One of the primary reasons shingle roofs are cheaper is that the materials are far less expensive, costing around $1 to $2.50 (CAD 1.34 to CAD 3.34) per square foot for mid-range asphalt architectural shingle. Shingle roofs are also significantly faster and less specialized to install than metal roofing, so labor costs are lower as well.

How Long Does a Metal Roof Last?
--------------------------------

While it may seem like a no-brainer to install asphalt shingle to save money, that's not the whole story. While an asphalt shingle roof is certainly cheaper upfront, [Bob Vila](https://www.bobvila.com/articles/metal-roof-pros-and-cons/) says you can only expect your roof to last between 12 and 20 years before you need to replace it. Meanwhile, metal roofs have an expected lifespan of up to 70 years and often come with generous manufacturer's warranties spanning decades. So, depending on how long you expect to live in your home, a new metal roof may be the last one you’ll ever need.

Furthermore, metal roofs can withstand rain and adverse weather more robustly than asphalt shingles, making them a good option for homeowners living in more extreme climates who want to avoid leaks or replacing their roofs too often. Metal roofing systems also hold up better in the snow than most other roof types because of the smooth surface that doesn't allow large amounts of snow to accumulate, which can cause the roof to buckle.
