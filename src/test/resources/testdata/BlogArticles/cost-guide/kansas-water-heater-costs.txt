  Blanketed in endless acres of those proverbial “amber waves of grain,” it’s no wonder Kansas is considered the heart of America’s Breadbasket. The Sunflower State may even contain our country’s geographical center (depending on [who you ask](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwj9-sL7lffxAhXMc98KHQUhAngQFjAYegQIIhAD&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ngs.noaa.gov%2FPUBS_LIB%2FGeoCenter_USA1.pdf&usg=AOvVaw2727U3w4dtPr_9AEKSHMnc)). But if one thing’s sure to hit you in your personal breadbasket, it’s how much it can cost to have your water heater serviced. Thankfully, the average price to repair or replace your water heater in Kansas is lower than the national average.

Your water heater powers your dishwasher, clothes washer and the hot shower you crave at the end of the day. When it goes kaput, it's not so much a matter of _whether_ you should have it serviced, but how much that service will cost. And if your hot water is already out, the last thing you want right now is to be blindsided by exorbitant water heater service fees. If you’re calling around for estimates, these figures should give you a ballpark idea of how much you can expect to pay, from Garden City to Topeka.

Repair and replacement costs vary depending on where you live. For comparison, the national average for diagnosis is $99, for repair is $493 and for replacement is $1,741.

The following average prices are based on aggregated HomeServe data reported by our network of contractors across Kansas:

Water Heater Diagnosis: $84
---------------------------

First, the technician has to determine what’s wrong with your water heater. The diagnostic fee is what they’ll charge to tell you whether your unit needs to be repaired or replaced. In the Wheat State, this fee is about 15% lower than the national average.

Water Heater Repair: $263
-------------------------

Any of a number of things may be going wrong with your water heater — issues with the gas control valve, a faulty thermostat or a combination of several malfunctions. This average repair price includes replacement parts and the labor to install them. Repairs cost Kansans an average of 47% less than the U.S. overall.

Water Heater Replace: $1,488
----------------------------

Water heaters only last about 10 years, so a breakdown might be a sign that yours is on its way out. At the end of your water heater’s usable life, you’re gonna need a new one. The average replacement price in Kansas is 15% less than the nation’s.

(Note that HomeServe water heater data should generally be assumed to refer to conventional “tanked” models — the most common type — as opposed to tankless or “on-demand” models, which can cost roughly twice as much.)
