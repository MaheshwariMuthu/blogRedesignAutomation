  Nothing says “Pacific Northwest” quite like a Dungeness crab boil. A steaming helping of the local catch drenched in butter… Most Oregonians can’t imagine a tastier meal. But when you turn on the tap to find there’s no hot water to wash the dishes, you might be in a bit of a pickle. The first thing on your mind is likely how _spendy_ water heater services can be. Actually, the cost to repair or replace your water heater in Oregon is the same or lower than the national average.

Your water heater powers your dishwasher, clothes washer and the hot shower you crave at the end of the day. When it goes kaput, it's not so much a matter of _whether_ you should have it serviced, but how much that service will cost. And if your hot water is already out, the last thing you want right now is to be blindsided by exorbitant water heater service fees. If you’re calling around for estimates, these figures should give you a ballpark idea of how much you can expect to pay in the Beaver State.

Repair and replacement costs vary depending on where you live. For comparison, the national average for diagnosis is $99, for repair is $493 and for replacement is $1,741.

The following average prices are based on aggregated HomeServe data reported by our network of contractors across Oregon.

Water Heater Diagnosis: $104
----------------------------

The diagnostic fee is what the technician will charge you to tell you what’s wrong with your system and whether it needs to be repaired or replaced. In Oregon, you’ll pay 5 bucks more than the national average.

Water Heater Repair: $386
-------------------------

Any of a number of things may be going wrong with your water heater — issues with the gas control valve, a faulty thermostat or a combination of several malfunctions. This average repair price includes replacement parts and the labor to install them. Repairs cost Oregonians an average of 22% less than they do in the U.S. overall.

Water Heater Replace: $1,439
----------------------------

Water heaters only last about 10 years, so breakdown might be a sign that yours is on its way out. If that’s the case with your unit, you’ll have to shell out for a new one. Oregon’s average replacement price is about 17% less than the nation’s.

(Note that HomeServe water heater data should generally be assumed to refer to conventional “tanked” models — the most common type — as opposed to tankless or “on-demand” models, which can cost roughly twice as much.)
