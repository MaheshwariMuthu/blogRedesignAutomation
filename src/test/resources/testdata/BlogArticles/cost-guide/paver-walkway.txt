  A walkway is more than just a way to cut through the yard without stomping on the well-manicured lawn. It can also be a nice decorative addition to your landscaping. Unlike a poured concrete walkway, you can use pavers to play with color and even create unique patterns.

Paver walkway costs can vary depending on the size of the walkway and what it's made of. Here’s how much it’ll cost you.

How Much Does a Paver Walkway Cost?
-----------------------------------

The cost to install paver walkways depends on the overall size of the walkway and whether you install it yourself or pay a contractor. According to [LawnStarter](https://www.lawnstarter.com/blog/cost/paver-walkway-price), the average cost of a paver path is between $1,430 and $3,530 (CAD 1,912 and CAD 4,700), including both materials and labor costs. In general, you can expect to pay about $9 (CAD 12) per square foot for basic pavers or $20 (CAD 27) per square foot for high-end materials.

When you're working out your project costs, don't forget to take into account any other additions you're considering, such as landscaping or lighting along the edges of the pathway. These additional costs can make a big difference to the total expense of your project.

If you're a skilled DIYer, you can install your own paver walkway. This way, you can save on labor costs. That said, be sure to factor in the cost of having any waste or debris from your previous path removed.

Is It Cheaper to Lay Concrete or Pavers?
----------------------------------------

If you're on a budget, it makes sense to consider the cost of different materials when you're planning your paver walkway installation. Your choice of sidewalk pavers can make a big difference in terms of look and price.

Concrete walkways cost less than mid-grade or high-end pavers. Flagstone walkways are comparatively expensive. [Lawn Love](https://lawnlove.com/blog/flagstone-patio-cost/) says costs range from $15 to $27 (CAD 20 to CAD 36) per square foot. Pavers — especially budget varieties — offer a good compromise between price and attractiveness, and are hard-wearing, too. With proper maintenance, you can expect your walkway to serve you well for a decade or more, so choose a timeless style that you and any future homeowners will love.

If you want something that looks similar to higher-end pavers for a lower cost, a stamped concrete walkway could be a cost-effective option, but you'll have more options in terms of appearance (such as natural stone, flagstone or slate) if you choose the real thing.

Why Choose a Paver Walkway?
---------------------------

If you're already working on upgrading your yard, having a walkway fitted makes a lot of sense and could save you time and money. Paver walkways are attractive, versatile and relatively easy to maintain.

The appearance of your yard or garden can make a huge difference to the value of your home and can boost your own enjoyment of the property while you live there. It's worth taking that into consideration when you're taking on projects like this one. Design your yard in a way that will make you happy for a long time to come — and that may be attractive to future buyers.

Whether you opt for brick pavers, natural stone or some other paving material, you'll want to keep your garden looking at its best once the work is done. Regular, careful maintenance is an important part of looking after your home.
