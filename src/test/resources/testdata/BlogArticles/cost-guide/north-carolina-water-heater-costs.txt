  An icy cold shower: That’s a tell-tale sign your water heater’s needs fixed — and, darn, you were _just_ fixin’ to call someone about that. If you’re down a water heater in the Tar Heel State, you can rest easy knowing the cost to repair or replace it where you live is less than the national average.

While you _could_ go without a water heater for a while, you certainly wouldn’t want to. But how much will it cost to get it back up and running? If you’re calling around for estimates, it can be helpful to have some sort of expectation of what you’ll need to pay. These numbers should give you a good idea of what a repair or replacement will cost in North Cackalacky.

Repair and replacement costs vary depending on where you live. For comparison, the national average for diagnosis is $99, for repair is $493 and for replacement is $1,741.

The following average prices are based on aggregated HomeServe data reported by our network of contractors across North Carolina.

Water Heater Diagnosis: $89
---------------------------

The diagnostic fee is what the technician will charge you to tell you what’s wrong with your system and whether it needs to be repaired or replaced. In North Carolina, this fee is about 10% lower than the national average.

Water Heater Repair: $364
-------------------------

Your technician will tell you what’s up with your water heater. It could be the thermostat, heating element or a combination of several malfunctions. This average repair price includes replacement parts and the labor to install them. Repairs cost North Carolinians an average of 26% less than the U.S. overall.

Water Heater Replace: $1,686
----------------------------

If you’ve gotten 10 years out of your water heater, consider yourself lucky. That’s about the average lifespan of these machines. If yours is older than that, this breakdown might be a sign that it has reached the end of its useful life, in which case, you’ll have to shell out for a new one. To replace your water heater in North Carolina, you’ll pay about 3% less than the average American.

(Note that HomeServe water heater data should generally be assumed to refer to conventional “tanked” models — the most common type — as opposed to tankless or “on-demand” models, which can cost roughly twice as much.)
