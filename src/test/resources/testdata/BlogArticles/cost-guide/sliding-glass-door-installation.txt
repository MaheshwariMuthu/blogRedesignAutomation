Which Sliding Doors Are the Most Affordable?
--------------------------------------------

Sliding doors come in a variety of sizes and frame types. The most affordable doors have vinyl frames, which are lightweight and easy to clean. However, they may warp if exposed to extreme temperatures. Other options include metal, wood, fiberglass and composite.

* **Wood frames:** Aesthetically pleasing but require painting or treating on a regular basis to prevent the wood from rotting
* **Metal frames:** Strong and durable but cost far more than vinyl ones, and their appearance may not match more traditional properties
* **Aluminum frames:** Lightweight and strong, but also good thermal conductors, which increases the risk of condensation.
* **Composite frames:** Strong, don't warp and offer a very good seal but are much more expensive than other types

Once you have new sliding doors for your patio, it's important to take good care of them. Clean the glass and the frames regularly and make sure the rollers are kept free from obstruction and debris, too. Make looking after the doors a part of your seasonal home maintenance checklist.
