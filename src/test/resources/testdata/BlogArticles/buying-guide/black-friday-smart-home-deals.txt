You’ve made your list, and you’ve checked it twice: You know what gifts you’re getting for everyone, from your in-laws to your coworkers. But maybe your home could also use some gear this year. If you’re in the market for smart home products like video doorbells, smart assistants, robot vacuums and Wi-Fi-connected appliances, Black Friday is one of the best days of the year to find great discounts.

This year, Black Friday falls on Nov. 26, but many retailers have already announced sales on smart home products. Here’s our guide to some of the best deals of Black Friday 2021.

Where Can You Find Black Friday Deals on Smart Home Products?
-------------------------------------------------------------

Sale flyers and online sales announcements are a good place to start. [BlackFriday.com](https://blackfriday.com) has rounded up scans of the sale flyers from the major retailers so you can find them all in one place.

But not all stores are going that route this year. Some reward those who are quick on their keyboards with the online equivalent to doorbuster deals. With [Best Buy](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/black-friday/sale-ad), for instance, be on the lookout for [daily flash deals](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/misc/deal-of-the-day/pcmcat248000050016.c?id=pcmcat248000050016). Amazon has dropped some [hints](https://press.aboutamazon.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amazon-announces-more-deals-ever-its-48-hour-black-friday-event?ots=1) as to what we can expect to be on sale (like Alexa-enabled devices and Amazon-branded products), but they've also announced “Lightning Deals” with a limited number of available discounts.

Many of the retailers on this list are also offering early Black Friday deals or season-long deals — likely due to [supply chain issues](https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/15/cnn-underscored/best-black-friday-deals-2021/index.html) that might cause shipping delays. And don’t forget about Cyber Monday deals. Many “Black Friday” sales extend through Nov. 29, but retailers may offer additional savings for the online shopping day.

How Can You Be Sure You’re Getting the Best Price?
--------------------------------------------------

Most traditional retailers offer some form of price matching. Show them an advertised price of the same product from a different retailer, and they’ll match that better price. Make sure to read the fine print, though; some stores don’t price match during the holiday shopping season.

This year, some retailers are matching their own prices. If a fresh sale hits and the set of security cameras you bought is now advertised at a lower price, the store may refund you the difference. Again: Check the offer details for cutoff dates and ineligible items.

Extended return windows are a staple of holiday shopping. Keep your receipts and note the return-by dates; items you bought as far back as October may still be returnable in January.

Top Black Friday Smart Home Deals for 2021
------------------------------------------

The prices and offer dates listed here are those advertised by some of the most popular national and online retailers. In some cases, certain items are on sale for the same or similar price at multiple retailers. Retailers’ prices — as well as product availability — may vary. Remember: Many Black Friday deals are only valid “while supplies last.”
