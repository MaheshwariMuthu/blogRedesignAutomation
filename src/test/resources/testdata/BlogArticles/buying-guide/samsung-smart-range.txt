There's nothing more annoying than lovingly preparing a roast, only to discover that the meat is undercooked or — worse — burnt to a crisp. A smart range helps you avoid this problem by controlling the cooking process more precisely and letting you change the settings remotely for extra convenience.

If you've been shopping around for a smart cooker, you've probably heard of Samsung smart ranges. Although Samsung is probably best known for its smartphones and tablets, it also manufactures a wide range of smart home appliances. Here's how Samsung smart ranges work and what features they offer.

How Does a Samsung Smart Range Work?
------------------------------------

Samsung smart ranges differ from regular ranges because you can connect them to your home's Wi-Fi. This lets you control your cooker from your smartphone or another compatible device using the [SmartThings app](https://www.smartthings.com). 

One of the primary advantages of a Samsung smart oven is that you don't need to adjust the heat settings or cooking time manually, letting you multitask while your meal cooks. Samsung smart ranges have an integrated meat thermometer. It lets you know when your roast is finished cooking and sends an alert to your device, taking the guesswork out of calculating the cooking time and helping you avoid under or overcooked meat. You can also use a Bixby, Alexa or Google virtual assistant to control your appliance with your voice if your hands are full. 

Samsung smart ranges are designed to slide into your existing kitchen. There are various colors and finishes available, and you can choose between gas, electric and dual-fuel models. They also feature a smudge-proof finish that resists fingerprints and other greasy marks to help maintain a clean, shiny appearance. 

What Features Does the Samsung Smart Range Have?

Samsung smart ranges come with various advanced features depending on which model you select. Samsung smart ovens have an integrated Smart Dial that lets you select the settings using a single control knob. This feature makes the controls easier to navigate and allows for an uncluttered user interface. It operates using artificial intelligence to learn which settings you use most often to suggest the most appropriate cooking temperature and duration based on your habits. 

The ovens use a convection heating system to distribute heat evenly and cook your meal quicker. Samsung smart stoves also feature 3600 W Express Boil technology that lets you adjust the temperature far more quickly than a conventional stove. Many models also have an air fry mode, so you won't need to find space for a separate air frying appliance in your kitchen. 

Some models also have a removable divider that you can take out to create one big cooking space for large pans or replace to form two separate ovens. Once you've finished cooking, the oven can clean itself to save you the time and inconvenience of scrubbing it every few weeks. Some models include descaling and steam cleaning functions, so the only parts you'll need to clean by hand are the cooking racks.

How Do I Connect to Wi-Fi on My Samsung Range?
----------------------------------------------

A Samsung smart range has integrated Wi-Fi that lets you control it using your smartphone or virtual assistant. You'll need to connect it to the SmartThings app on your device before you can control it remotely via Wi-Fi. 

Start by installing the SmartThings app on your device and sign up for an account if you don't have one already. Once you've logged in, click on the “Devices” tab and then click on the plus sign to add an appliance. 

Find the Samsung item, click on it and select the “Ranges” option. The app will then provide step-by-step instructions to set up the connection to your Samsung smart range. Once you've finished, the app will remember your appliance so that you can control it easily from the SmartThings app homepage.
