Home to all of your groceries, your refrigerator is an important kitchen appliance. When it stops cooling efficiently, you risk spoiled foods and wasted energy. Follow these steps when it's time to invest in a new refrigerator:

## Determine size and capacity

Start by measuring your current refrigerator to determine the size that fits your kitchen. You'll also want to take note of how much room your kitchen allows for doors to open and close easily. Consider the capacity, which depends on how many people live in your home and how much food you plan to store. About 19 to 22 cubic feet is the average for a family of four. If you have little ones at home, check out these [kid-friendly refrigerator options](https://www.consumerreports.org/refrigerators/kid-friendly-refrigerators-that-please-parents/){target="_blank"} _Consumer Reports_ highlighted.

## Consider your style preferences

There are plenty of options for fridge style, including top or bottom freezer, as well as French and side-by-side doors. Next, choose a finish, such as stainless steel or matte black. The size and design of your kitchen may make these style decisions for you. Otherwise, it's up to your personal preference.

## Check out the features

## Weigh the pros and cons

If you've narrowed your options down but are still struggling to decide, compare the benefits and drawbacks of each unit. Plus, reach out to others for advice. Ask family, coworkers, and friends about their refrigerator buying experience, especially if they cook and consume food similarly to you. Head online to check out consumer reviews for the models you're deciding between. Investing in new appliances is a smart way for homeowners to keep their spaces updated and to help avoid immediate issues from wear and tear.
