Ahhh, nothing beats a summer breeze. Even if it comes from a fan, I'm a happy camper. In fact, it's those whirring fan blades that make spending time outside on the even the hottest days somewhat bearable.

As your [preparations for summer](/en-us/blog/home-improvement/summer-maintenance-checklist){target="_blank"} begin, it's time to get your outdoor spaces ready for the season. I promise you won't regret installing a ceiling fan on your porch or covered patio - just make sure it's designed to withstand the outside elements. Covered spaces are usually fine with a damp-rated fan, but wet-rated models are ideal for exposed areas.

Here are three of the best outdoor ceiling fans to consider:

## 1\. Kensgrove indoor/outdoor ceiling fan

At 72 inches, this fan can really keep you cool and comfortable in sticky hot weather. The fan also features an energy-efficient LED light bulb, which you can activate using the remote control. The sleek blades are perfect if you want a large modern fan with little required maintenance. Another bonus noted by Homeair: This fan [barely makes a noise](https://www.homeair.org/best-outdoor-ceiling-fan-reviews/){target="_blank"} so you can read, nap and relax in your cool comfort without distraction.

**Where to buy:** [Home Depot](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Home-Decorators-Collection-Kensgrove-72-in-LED-Indoor-Outdoor-Espresso-Bronze-Ceiling-Fan-with-Remote-Control-YG493OD-EB/301162064){target="_blank"} or [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07453TFLM/?creativeASIN=B07453TFLM&linkCode=w61&imprToken=H-2zMUO97VT9wCWUQxybNA&slotNum=0&tag=homeair0a-20){target="_blank"}.

## 2\. Monte Carlo Maverick collection

If you're looking for an Energy Star-qualified fan, the Monte Carlo Maverick is an approved fan to consider. The Maverick fans are safe for damp locations and feature softly rounded, hand-carved balsa wood blades for an elegant yet modern look. With six different finishes, you can choose the one that best compliments your outdoor style.

## 3\. Hunter Donegan indoor/outdoor ceiling fan

Listed among Home Depot's [best-rated ceiling fans](https://www.homedepot.com/b/Lighting-Ceiling-Fans/Best-Rated/Outdoor/N-5yc1vZbvlqZbwo5qZ1z17lkr){target="_blank"}, the Donegan has more of a casual than modern look. The bronze finish will complement rustic outdoor spaces, while the fresh white has an understated appearance. Simple, functional and powerful without making too much noise, this outdoor ceiling fan is a classic choice.

**Where to buy:** [Home Depot](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Hunter-Donegan-52-in-Indoor-Outdoor-Onyx-Bengal-Bronze-Ceiling-Fan-54167/207119810){target="_blank"}, [Lowe's](https://www.lowes.com/pd/Hunter-Donegan-52-in-Onyx-Bengal-Bronze-Indoor-Outdoor-Ceiling-Fan-5-Blade/1000091605){target="_blank"} or [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Hunter-Fan-Company-54167-Donegan/dp/B01CDFZIN8){target="_blank"}.

While you're focused on outdoor living, consider sprucing up your home's curb appeal with fresh landscaping and porch decor. This could also be the year you finally set up a fire pit in the backyard, perfect for chilly nights all year long.
