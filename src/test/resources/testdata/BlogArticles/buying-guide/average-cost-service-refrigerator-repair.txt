Last summer, as I was preparing to take my eldest off to her first year of college _(sniff, sniff)_, I encountered the huge hassle of needing an emergency refrigerator repair. During the hottest week of the summer, my refrigerator just stopped working. All plans for a going away BBQ were scrapped (along with all the fresh food that I had bought.) Our last day together was spent with me trying to find someone to come perform a refrigerator repair – just hours prior to hitting the road.

According to HomeServe internal reporting, it’s been found that refrigerator repairs make up **an average of 33% of deployed service calls for appliance home warranty plans. That means that the appliance that is most likely to break in your home is your refrigerator.** _(And we all know it’s probably the one appliance in our homes that we use the most.)_

Perhaps if I’d known in advance some of the [common refrigerator repair problems](/en-us/blog/home-improvement/common-refrigerator-problems){target="_blank"}, maybe I would have been able to avoid the hassle.

## Average cost to service the top 3 refrigerator brands?
In my case, I had a GE refrigerator that was here in my home when I purchased it many years back. While it lasted a good long time, it did need a repair every so often. _(Wish I had been prepared with_ [_a plan from HomeServe_](/en-us/home-warranty/appliances/){target="_blank"} _as it would have saved me some money on refrigerator repairs.)_

The recent data collected by HomeServe during April through June 2020, shows that if you have a GE, Whirlpool or Frigidaire refrigerator, it’s likely to breakdown. So you can expect to pay the following, on average, to repair the top 3 refrigerator brands:

### 1. GE (Average = $290.40)
### 2. Whirlpool (Average = $266.80)
### 3. Frigidaire (Average = $234.40)

It’s also important to remember that appliance repair costs can include parts, as well as the labor costs. When replacement parts are readily available, refrigerator repair times can sometimes only require a few hours by a professional technician.

## The refrigerator repair cost variations
Refrigerator repair costs can vary by factors such as [appliance make and model, home location, replacement parts required and problem severity](https://www.searshomeservices.com/blog/how-much-should-appliance-repairs-cost){target="_blank"}, according to Sears Home Services. For instance, lesser-known brands, older models with limited replacement parts availability and refrigerators with computerized components typically incur increased repair costs. Of course, service fees and hourly labor charges will also depend on the technician.

## What to do with a decades old refrigerator?
Before you say “yes” to a refrigerator repair, consider whether your hard-earned money should perhaps be put toward replacing it with a [brand-new fridge](/en-us/blog/buying-guide/refrigerator){target="_blank"}. Here are some things to consider:

* **Age:** Deciding when to replace a fridge isn’t easy. _SF Gate_ suggests that [repairing refrigerators that are less than eight years old](https://homeguides.sfgate.com/decide-replace-refrigerator-26898.html){target="_blank"} and replacing those that have been around for 15+ years.
* **Energy efficiency:** Refrigerators are one of the highest energy-consuming appliances you have. If you don't have an Energy Star-certified refrigerator, you might consider upgrading. Replacing an old refrigerator with an energy efficient model could save you [more than $300](https://www.energystar.gov/products/appliances/refrigerators){target="_blank"} over the next 5 years, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.
* **Calculate your fridge’s life span:** Find out how much your old refrigerator or freezer [costs to operate](https://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?fuseaction=refrig.calculator){target="_blank"} and how much you can save.

## Maintenance is key
Lastly, like many things in your home, maintenance is important. Keeping your refrigerator in good shape can sometimes help avoid repair costs. Things like keeping it clean on the inside to reduce the chances of accumulating bacteria; make sure there’s proper ventilation around the outside and inside, so don’t overcrowd it; look for tears, gaps or air leaks in the door gaskets; change your water filter and clean dust off the condenser coils a couple of times a year. Try some of these [DIY hacks to help improve the efficiency of your fridge](/en-us/blog/home-improvement/refrigerator-efficiency-tips){target="_blank"}.

Being without a functioning refrigerator is a huge hassle. Knowing how much the average refrigerator repair cost is can be helpful. What’s even more helpful is being prepared prior to a refrigerator repair.
