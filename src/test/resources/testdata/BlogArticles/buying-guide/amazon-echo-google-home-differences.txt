## The comparisons

Both smart speakers have a similar repertoire of features and capabilities. However, a significant difference is that the Amazon Echo® is a few years older than the Google Home®, which means it currently has a longer list of features and partners. It’s important to read up on each devices and the services that each speaker supports (such as smart thermostats, lighting, Spotify®, YouTube®, Uber® and Netflix®) - to see which brand offers the features that you want and are most likely to use.

Of course, each smart speaker supports its own platforms, making the choice easy if you are already team Amazon® or team Google®. For instance, those obsessed with Amazon Prime® may lean toward the Echo while those who are already using Google Play Music® and Chromecast® may head in the direction of the Home.

Smart speakers aren’t visually works of art, but each brand does offer a selection of colors and finishes to meet your design and interior decor preferences. As far as price goes, the Google Home® is slightly more expensive than the Amazon Echo®.

## The offerings

Both brands offer a family of smart speakers. Amazon® has the original, plus a smaller Amazon Echo Dot® and the more advanced Amazon Echo Plus®. Google® has versions called the Mini and the Max. New Amazon Echo® offerings also include the Spot, Show and Look, which have screens to accompany the speaker. 

While the smaller smart speakers are comparable in price, the Google Home Max® is far more expensive than the Amazon Echo Plus®. The reasoning is that the Max can do everything the original can do, but it has far superior speaker quality. It’s designed for music lovers who want high audio quality with the bonus of smart features.

If you're a die-hard fan of either Amazon® or Google®, then your brand allegiance might make the decision easy for you.
