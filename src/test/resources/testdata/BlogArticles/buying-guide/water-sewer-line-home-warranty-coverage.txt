To protect yourself from these kinds of financial mishaps, you might want to invest in sewer line insurance. This type of insurance offers additional coverage for replacements, major repairs and other issues that might arise due to problems with your sewer lines.

How Does Sewer Line Insurance Work?
-----------------------------------

For a monthly fee, you’ll have access to an expert technician who will come to your house and repair your sewer lines whenever you have an issue. This could include sewer backup, water backup, sump pump issues, blocked sewer pipes, collapsed water lines and much more. Not all policies are alike, so make sure you read thoroughly before you sign off on an insurance policy. Think about problems that you've had in the past and the type of coverage that you might need in the future as your system ages.  
  
When you file a claim, a licensed technician will repair or replace the parts of your sewer line that caused the issue. When they're done, you might have to sign a form that signifies that you accept the repairs. Some insurance companies only pay for repairs up to a certain dollar amount. If your repairs cost more than that, you may have to pay for the rest out of pocket. Otherwise, your insurance may cover the full cost of your repairs.

Average Cost for Sewer Line Insurance
-------------------------------------

The cost of your insurance depends on your location and the amount of coverage that you want for your sewer system. Most insurance companies offer a base price and start from there. Typically, starting prices run around $7 to $8 per month. The cost may be discounted if you combine a sewer line policy with other insurance policies.

Sewer Line Insurance Coverage Breakdown
---------------------------------------

Even if you just hired someone to install a new sewer system, the pipes will inevitably start to break down over time. If you have an old system attached to your house, you might be paying for repairs sooner rather than later. Your policy could cover a wide range of services, like:

*   Pipe cutting, fusing and welding
*   Unclogging blockages that might cause the sewer to back up
*   Digging up the pipe to locate the issue, then backfilling the area or fixing the pavement
*   Finding the source of the issue
*   Replacing pipes that are broken, leaking or collapsed
*   Replacing valves, seals and joints
*   Landscaping and yard repair from digging

  
Some packages offer more services than others, so make sure you look at the covered repairs before you sign a contract. If you have an old system, you might want to look for a plan that includes full sewer line replacement.

Sewer Line Replacement Coverage
-------------------------------

In extreme cases, you might need full sewer line replacement. This is an extensive procedure that might involve digging up your yard and replacing the water lines. It's also incredibly expensive, often costing homeowners thousands of dollars or more. While you may qualify for a tax deduction, you may still have to pay thousands of dollars up front.  
  
If you think you might need a sewer line replacement in the near future, it's even more important to buy coverage. In exchange for a monthly fee, your sewer line insurance might pay for part or all of your replacement costs. You could fix your plumbing _and_ enjoy a better quality of life without draining your bank account.

The Benefits of Sewer Line Insurance
------------------------------------

You might not think you'll need it now, but sewer line insurance could be of the most important investments you make for your home. Here are just a few of the benefits of buying sewer insurance coverage:

*   If a pipe suddenly bursts or collapses, you could get it repaired as quickly as possible, even if you don't have thousands of dollars to pay for it up front.
*   You might be able to upgrade your system if you have outdated pipes and water lines that cause issues in your home.
*   You could eliminate problems that you've been dealing with for the past several months, like clogged toilets or sewage backing up into your basement.
