I'm notorious for being indecisive. And when it comes to making appliance purchase decisions, I frustrate my family with my never-ending self-doubt. So needless to say, every appliance purchase becomes more difficult than it should be. Case in point, when I had to buy a new stainless steel refrigerator for my just-renovated kitchen, I was beyond overwhelmed. There were so many different finishes, doors, sizes _(who knew “counter depth” was an option?)_ Not to mention, the configuration of shelves, drawers and fancy compartment features I had to consider. AHHHHHH!

What helped me finalize my decision was to make my way down a [list of refrigerator styles, features and considerations](/en-us/blog/buying-guide/refrigerator){target="_blank"} – it was super helpful in determining “must-haves”. (_Turns out I'm a stainless-steel, French-door, Energy Star-certified kind of refrigerator buyer_.)

Once you know what kind of model you want, here are some suggestions for top-rated refrigerators to help you narrow down the options.

## The best French-door refrigerators

The French-door model is a current fan favorite for today's homeowners, offering a full-width refrigerator compartment at eye level and pull-out refrigerator drawer (and sometimes drawers) underneath. The industry experts at _[Wirecutter](https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/the-best-refrigerator/){target="\_blank"}_ and _[CNET](https://www.cnet.com/topics/refrigerators/best-refrigerators/){target="\_blank"}_ named the following French-door refrigerators as the best models of 2019:

::: list-square
* Whirlpool WRF535SMHZ
* Maytag MFI2570FEZ
* GE PFE28KMKES
* Kenmore 72482

## The best side-by-side refrigerators

For homeowners who prefer an equal ratio between fresh and frozen compartments, side-by-side refrigerators are the best option. Consumer Reports notes that side-by-side models are [ideal for narrow kitchen spaces, and generally use less electricity](https://www.consumerreports.org/cro/refrigerators.htm){target="_blank"}. Top-rated models, according to _Wirecutter, CNET, [Good Housekeeping](https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/appliances/refrigerator-reviews/g179/best-refrigerators/){target="\_blank"}_ and _[ConsumersAdvocate.org](https://www.consumersadvocate.org/refrigerators){target="\_blank"}_, include:

* GE GSE25HSHSS
* LG LSXS26326S
* Whirlpool WRS586FIEM
* Frigidaire FFSS2625TS

::: list-square
* Whirlpool WRB322DMBB
* LG LDCS24223S
* GE ABE20EGHBS
* Kenmore Elite 79043

## The best top-freezer refrigerators

Generally the least expensive style, top-freezers are a good pick for homeowners looking for a reliable, no-frills appliance or the best refrigerator deal. Some of the best options include:

* GE GTS18GTHWW
* GE GTE18GMHES
* LG LTCS24223S
* Frigidaire FFTR1514TB

## The best compact fridges

The best refrigerator for a kitchenette, dorm room, office, game room or compact space is a mini-fridge: small, simple, affordable and efficient. _[The Spruce](https://www.thespruce.com/best-refrigerators-4113149){target="\_blank"}_ and _[Digital Trends](https://www.digitaltrends.com/home/best-mini-fridges/){target="\_blank"}_ recommend the following:

* Magic Chef Mini HMBR265SE1
* Danby DAR033A6BDB
* Midea WHS-65L
* Frigidaire FFPS4533QM

## The best smart refrigerator

If you're into technology and a smart home life, the Samsung Family Hub Refrigerator gets the top ratings from most industry experts for its tech-savvy features.
