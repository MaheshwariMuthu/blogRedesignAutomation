One of the most important decisions you can make following the purchase of an electric vehicle is how you’re going to charge it. Keeping your vehicle fully charged when at home keeps you from being stranded when the battery runs out on the road.

Choosing the best EV charger for your home can be confusing. Consider the benefits that a Level 2 EV charger provides when shopping for your home charging station.

Is a Level 2 Home Charger Worth It?
-----------------------------------

A Level 2 EV home charger uses a 240-volt power supply compared to the 120-volt power supply that comes with a Level 1 charger. The Level 2 charger can provide a full charge up to 10 times faster. Whether it’s worth it to purchase a Level 2 charger depends on the type of electric vehicle you purchase and your driving habits.

To determine whether you need to upgrade your charger, consider how frequently you drive, the total distance you travel to and from work and whether you need your car for additional errands each day. A Level 1 charger provides enough charge to let you drive an additional 2 to 5 miles for each hour you charge the vehicle. For those who own hybrids, this range may be just fine, but full-electric vehicle owners have often found the need for upgraded chargers.

Can I Use the Charger That Came With the Car?
---------------------------------------------

This depends on the type of charger your vehicle manufacturer provided you. Some vehicles come with Level 2 chargers that can deliver a full charge when you leave it overnight. If your vehicle arrived with a Level 1 charger, it could take days to bring an electric vehicle to full charge. If you plan on driving your electric car regularly for trips longer than 40 miles, you need a Level 2 EV home charger.

Level 1 chargers are ideal if you own a hybrid vehicle. Hybrids require less power to charge the battery between uses, and the engine can charge the battery while the vehicle is in motion. Because full electric vehicles lack a gas-powered backup energy source and have larger batteries, it’s best to be able to charge them completely each day.

Top 5 Home Electric Vehicle Chargers
------------------------------------

When you compare home EV chargers, consider whether you’d like the features that come with a smart charger or if you’d save money without one. Some smart chargers cost more but have programming that can lower your electricity bill via demand response programs.

Here are the top five products to consider when searching for the best EV charger for you.

Consider an Electrical System Inspection Before Installing a Home Charging Station
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Adding a 240-volt charging station to your home increases the load on your electrical system. It’s a good idea to inspect your electric panel ahead of time to know that it can support the additional capacity. Electrical repairs can be far more expensive than upgrading your panel.

Owning a fully electric vehicle can strand you at home if your electrical system malfunctions because it deprives you of the car’s sole source of power. Electrical problems can pose hazards to your safety and property as well. Your appliances and HVAC system depend on electricity. Faulty wiring, power surges and other issues can cause a fire or keep you from using your heat and air conditioning during extreme weather.
