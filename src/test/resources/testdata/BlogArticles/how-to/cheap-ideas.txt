1\. Paint Your Front Door
-------------------------

Repainting your front door can change the look of your home, and it doesn't require many tools. Light neutrals help the door blend in while giving it a fresh look. Black is a classic yet bold option for a front door. Bright hues are also popular on front doors. They draw attention to your front door and add a splash of color to your façade. If the door is already primed, you'll likely only need a quart of paint. If you want to paint more doors, grab a gallon or more.

2\. Replace Doorknobs or Drawer Pulls
-------------------------------------

Outdated doorknobs and drawer pulls can make your space look old. If the cabinets and doors still look good and are sturdy, swapping out the hardware can make them more modern. Adding new hardware if your cabinets and drawers don't have any also gives the space a facelift. You can find door hardware in every style, from simple, sleek bar-style pulls to intricately detailed glass knobs.

3\. Invest in Storage Containers
--------------------------------

Putting some money into buying organizers and storage containers helps tidy up your space and make it more functional. Organizers for inside cabinets and closets help keep everything look clean, and they make things easier to find. Decorative baskets and storage containers that you leave out in the open add a little style to your room, all while giving everything its own place.

4\. Wall Mount Your TV
----------------------

Another simple purchase to help your space is a TV mount. You can securely attach the TV to a wall above a fireplace, cabinet or any other space. It gives the space a clean look and frees up the top of the entertainment center for other decorations. Many TV mounts swivel and adjust easily to get just the right positioning.

5\. Replace a Faucet
--------------------

Kitchen and bathroom faucets can be very expensive if you choose high-end models, but you can find a wide range of options under or just above $100 (CAD 125). Replacing an older faucet — especially if it doesn't work well or has a tarnished finish — creates a fresh focal point for your kitchen or bathroom. It can also make using the sink easier by giving you a faucet that works better than your old one. You can rent some tools to make the process even cheaper.

6\. Install Under-Cabinet Lighting
----------------------------------

Adding lighting below your upper kitchen cabinets isn't as expensive or difficult as you might think. You can get wireless under-cabinet lights that attach to the bottom of the cabinets with adhesive tape. Many of them have remotes and let you choose different color temperatures and brightness levels to get the light just right. The glow under your cabinets gives the kitchen an upscale look with no need for an electrician. Plus, you get the extra illumination, which makes it easier to prep food.

7\. Add a Peel-and-Stick Backsplash
-----------------------------------

While you're working in the kitchen, consider adding a peel-and-stick backsplash. The stick-on backsplash pieces replicate the look of many popular backsplash materials, such as subway tiles and natural stones. They're much cheaper and much easier to install than the real thing. If you rent, this is a great way to elevate your space without making a permanent change.

8\. Light Your Landscape
------------------------

Grab a pack of inexpensive solar lights to line a walkway or garden area. They come in a variety of styles and shapes to coordinate with your home's look. You can also get solar lights to attach along deck railings and steps to make those areas safer and add an upscale look. If you prefer the whimsical look of string lights, install strands of bulbs crisscrossing over your patio area to add a glow.

9\. Frame Your Bathroom Mirror
------------------------------

If you have the standard, frameless mirror in your bathroom, add a frame to jazz it up. You can cut a simple frame from wood and paint or stain it to fit your bathroom decor. Use decorative trim with designs carved into it if you want something a little more exciting. The frame gives the mirror a defined look and adds some interest to your walls.

Upgrades For Your Home
----------------------

How do you decide where to spend your budget for home upgrades? Start by figuring out which areas of your home look outdated or don't function well. For example, if the drawer pulls in your kitchen are loose and aren't easy to grab, replacing them is a logical choice.

Consider your skill level when choosing projects. Most of the upgrades on this list are that cheap because you're doing the work yourself. Pick projects you're comfortable handling on your own.

Make a list of projects you want to accomplish. Choose one to start, then continue working through the ideas as your budget and time allow.<br><iframe title="YouTube video player" width="1072" height="603" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tbq6uZ9Y0nQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
