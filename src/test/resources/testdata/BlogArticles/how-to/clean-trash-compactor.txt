But fear not, there’s something you can do about it that won’t take up too much of your time. Armed with a pair of gloves, some baking soda magic and a sprinkle of elbow grease, you can transform your compactor from funky to fresh.

How Do You Clean a Trash Compactor?
-----------------------------------

### Things You’ll Need:

*   A pair of gloves
*   A garbage bag suitable for the trash compactor
*   A sponge or cloth
*   Dish detergent
*   Warm water
*   Baking soda
*   A germ-killing deodorant spray
*   A vacuum cleaner or a broom and dustpan
*   A new charcoal air filter (optional)

### Step-by-Step Instructions:

**1\.** Unplug the trash compactor from the power outlet and turn off the circuit breaker if necessary. This will reduce the chances of accidents or injuries while you’re cleaning.

**2\.** Carefully remove the trash bag and dispose of it properly. You may need to use the manual lever to release the ram if it’s stuck.

**3\.** Wipe down the inside of the trash compactor with a sponge or cloth dampened with warm water and dish detergent. Pay attention to the corners, crevices and hinges where trash may be left behind. Rinse the sponge or cloth frequently and wring it out well so you’re not reapplying grime or grease as you wipe.

**4\.** Sprinkle some baking soda on the bottom and sides of the trash compactor. This will help neutralize any odors and absorb remaining moisture. Let it sit for about 15 minutes so it can work its magic, and then vacuum or sweep it up.

**5\.** Spray a germ-killing deodorant on the inside of the trash compactor, especially on the ram and the door, where germs are more likely to linger. This will help disinfect and deodorize it. Let it dry completely before using the compactor again.

**6\.** If your trash compactor has a charcoal air filter, you may want to replace it with a new one. The charcoal air filter helps reduce the smell, but it can get clogged or saturated over time. Check the manufacturer’s instructions on how to change the filter and how often to do it because not all compactors follow the same process.

**7\.** Pull out the trash compactor from the cabinet or wall and clean behind it with a vacuum cleaner or a broom and dustpan. Wipe down the back and sides of the trash compactor with a damp cloth and dish detergent. When it’s dry, push it back into place and plug it in.

**8\.** Replace the trash bag with a new one, making sure the bag fits snugly and securely around the bin. You can use a regular garbage bag or a specially designed trash compactor bag. Purpose-designed bags are typically more durable and resistant to punctures, so you might not have to clean them as often if you’re using them.

How Often Do You Need to Clean Your Trash Compactor?
----------------------------------------------------

The frequency of cleaning your trash compactor depends on several factors, such as how much and what kind of trash you compact, how humid or dry your location is and how sensitive you are to odors. Generally speaking, you should clean your trash compactor at least once a month or more often if you notice any of the following signs:

*   It smells bad or emits a foul odor, even when the door is closed.
*   It leaks or drips liquid or grease from the bottom or the sides.
*   It attracts flies, ants, roaches or other pests.
*   It makes loud or unusual noises or doesn’t operate smoothly or properly.

By cleaning your trash compactor regularly, you can extend its life span, improve its performance and maintain its hygiene. A clean trash compactor can also make your kitchen more pleasant and inviting.<br><iframe title="YouTube video player" width="1072" height="603" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fJO-ZnL118A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen title="Electrical Safety | Tips and Tricks for New Homeowners"></iframe>
