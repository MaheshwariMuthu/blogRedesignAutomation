But how do you transition from your makeshift workspace on the couch to a more permanent solution? Here’s how to turn a spare bedroom or another unused area into a functional workspace.

Home Office Ideas
-----------------

If you work from home, you need a designated area to call a home office. If you just pull up at the kitchen counter or sit on the living room couch, the daily distractions of your home will overwhelm you. Maybe you have a spare bedroom or a den that can be utilized and transformed into an office. There are many options for turning a spare room into a place you can work.

How to Set Up Your Home Office
------------------------------

Before outfitting your home office, consider the things you will need most in the space. It doesn’t have to look like a traditional office for you to be productive. This is your area. You can add pieces of furniture for functionality and to help you feel happy and productive.

Here's a how-to to inspire you to create an office from a spare room:

### 1\. Find the Right Space in Your Home to Set Up Your Office

Look around your home and see if there is a space that is not being used regularly. It might be a spare bedroom, a walk-in closet, a den, the basement or maybe even the attic — just somewhere that is big enough to put your desk, chair, couch and other furniture you need.

You are going to need somewhere to go to get away from everyday distractions. It will be difficult to get any work done if you don’t have that separation. You don’t need a large space, just one big enough to house the items you need to be successful at work.

### 2\. Think About What Tasks You Need to Accomplish in Your Office

You will need to design your room around your work needs. For example, do you have to hop on Zoom calls all day? Think about creating an aesthetic background. If you need a space to spread out paperwork and books, you might want a larger desk. Or, maybe you want something scenic to look at while you think through problems in your job. Whatever you do during the day, consider those tasks when you are designing your office.

Don’t forget storage solutions. If your work needs a lot of supplies or paperwork, you will need space to store these items. Knowing what you are going to need ahead of time will help you decide how the end product should look.

### 3\. Pick a Decor Theme

A lot of time is spent decorating office buildings to help employees feel comfortable and productive. That’s why it is important to take time to decorate your personal office in a style that resonates with you. It’ll help you get in the right mindset for work.

There are so many office decor possibilities. You can go modern, retro, elegant or rustic. The way you decorate should incorporate the functionality you need with a look that is appealing to you. Just because a specific desk or chair looks nice, it may not be comfortable. Balance out the design with the function so you can get work done.

### 4\. Select the Right Size Desk

What do you do on your desk? Will you just need a spot for a computer or tablet, or do you need space to spread out? Also, think about size in terms of what the room will allow. Then, determine what type of desk you want. Will a built-in desk work, or will a stand-alone one be best?

Would you prefer one of the popular stand-up desks? You need to know the amount of space that you have to work with and what you are able to do with it. You may only need a desk that will impress by size, boldness, material or color.

### 5\. Incorporate an Accent Chair

You will be most productive if you are comfortable in your space. An accent chair can be a fun way to add comfortable seating to your area. This chair might be a perfect place to make phone calls, hop on Zoom or give you somewhere else to sit and work during the day.

### 6\. Light Up the Room With the Right Fixtures

Lighting is an important part of any workspace. Poor light can be bad for your eyes and can cause headaches and eye strain. Lighting is a great way to bring ambiance to a room and help you feel comfortable.

At certain times of the day, direct sunlight into your office can cause glare issues on your screens. The best thing to do in your office is to provide a layering of light. Task lamps can be used for focused work. The ability to dim and brighten the room's ambient light is also a great feature.

### 7\. Create Storage Solutions

Papers, papers and more papers: That’s what will become of your new home office soon enough. Finding a way to store these is very important. Luckily, you’ve got a lot of options for storage, such as filing cabinets, wall storage, cute bins, boxes and more.

If you’re using a spare bedroom for your new office, you can store all your papers and supplies in the closet. If you don’t have a closet, you'll need to get more creative. Little bins are cute, but keep in mind that they don’t hold a lot. Determine your needs and then shop the many options accordingly.

### 8\. Add Personality to Your Space

Finally, when you are designing your home office, you’ll want to add some personality. Make it your own! You will probably spend a lot of time in this room, so make it a place that brings you joy. Bring in personal photos, find a place to throw in a pop of color or display some memorabilia. Create a space you love because you will be spending a lot of time there.

How Do Tax Deductions Work for Home Offices?
--------------------------------------------

When you run a business from home, there are many different things that you can deduct from your taxes. You have to keep a record of how much of the house is used for business purposes, money spent on the business, supplies bought and many more things that are tax-deductible.

Tax deductions depend on how and why you’re working from home. If you’re self-employed, there are many deductions that you can claim. When you are employed by someone else and file a W-2, things work a little bit differently. Consult an accountant to see what deductions apply in your case.

Where to Buy Office Furniture
-----------------------------

You can find office furniture in many places, not just office supply stores. Before heading out to get furniture, look around your home and see what items can be repurposed. Then, you can start shopping for what you are looking for online or browse local office supply stores to see what you like. If you’re looking for a used option, shop places like Facebook Marketplace for desks and chairs. People are always selling office furniture that might be perfect for your home.
