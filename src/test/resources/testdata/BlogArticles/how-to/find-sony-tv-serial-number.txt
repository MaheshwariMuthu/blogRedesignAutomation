Here's how to locate your Sony TV's serial number on the product sticker or through your television's settings.

TV Serial Numbers
-----------------

The serial number on your Sony TV is a unique identifier assigned to your television by the manufacturer. Your Sony TV's serial number allows the manufacturer to track things like warranty repairs. Companies sometimes use serial numbers to track and recall faulty televisions, such as if they discover that a batch contains incorrect components.

Why Might You Need to Know Your TV's Serial Number?
---------------------------------------------------

The primary reason you might need to know your Sony TV's serial number is to register the warranty. You'll usually need to supply the serial number upon registration so that the manufacturer can identify your particular TV.

Knowing your Sony TV's serial number could also come in handy if your television is stolen. If you have a smart TV and someone connects it to the internet, the police can use its serial number to track the IP address and locate your Sony TV. You usually need to have your TV on hand to access the serial number, so it's a good idea to note it down as soon as possible after you purchase it.

What Are Some Ways to Find the Serial Number on a Sony TV?
----------------------------------------------------------

### On the TV

You can find your Sony TV's serial number on the product sticker attached to the TV and its original packaging. The sticker also features the TV's model number, and you can differentiate it from the serial number because the model number contains letters. The product sticker should be on the back of your Sony TV in one of the corners.
