  The views through your skylight are gorgeous, and you can't beat the extra light you get. But your skylight needs regular maintenance to keep it looking clear and to prevent major leaking issues.

With its location on the roof, a skylight is especially prone to leaks. Skylight cleaning is a major part of the upkeep process.

How Do You Clean Skylights?
---------------------------

The rooftop location is what gives your skylight its charm, but it also adds a challenge when it comes to skylight cleaning. It can be difficult to reach both the inside and outside of the window for cleaning purposes, especially if you have an extra-high ceiling.

Indoor skylight cleaning usually requires a sturdy ladder. It should be tall enough so you can safely reach the skylight to clean it. Check the manufacturer's recommendations for cleaning supplies. The type of material and special coatings might impact what's safe to use on the skylight. You can generally clean it well with a soft cloth and water. Here are the steps:

1\. Dust the skylight to remove loose dust and cobwebs.

2\. Spray a cloth with water.

3\. Wipe all surfaces of the skylight with the cloth.

4\. Go over the window with a clean, damp cloth to remove any leftover residue.

5\. Wipe the window with a dry cloth to prevent streaking.

Cleaning the outside of the skylight is a lot more challenging due to its location on the roof. It can be dangerous to climb on your roof, and the water you use to clean the skylight can make the roof slippery. If you're not comfortable with it, hire a professional window company to clean the exterior once or twice per year. The pros know how to clean the skylight safely and have the right safety equipment for the job.

If you want to do the work yourself, water with mild soap and a soft, non-abrasive cloth can clean it well. Follow these steps:

1\. Remove any sticks or leaves from the skylight.

2\. Wipe the skylight with the soapy water.

3\. Rinse it well with clean water.

4\. Dry the skylight.

5\. Look for potential damage once it's clean.

What Other Tasks Do You Need to Do to Maintain Skylights and Prevent Leaks?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

While skylight cleaning is a major part of the routine, there are other skylight maintenance tasks you should perform. Those include:

* **Visual inspections.** Look up to your skylight regularly to look for early signs of leaks or damage. If anything looks different, get a closer look or call a window company to look into the situation.
* **Schedule yearly inspections.** Your inspections might reveal issues, but it's also a good idea to have a pro look at your skylight. They can get on the roof to get a closer look from above and check the flashing and roof around the skylight.
* **Test mechanisms.** If your skylight opens for ventilation, test the mechanisms routinely to make sure they work correctly. An issue with the mechanism could interfere with the skylight closing properly, which introduces the risk of leaks.

What Are the Biggest Concerns About Skylights and Skylight Maintenance?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Leaking is a major concern when it comes to skylights. Improper installation can cause leaks from the start. Over time, the skylight can become damaged due to issues with the flashing or impact from things falling on it. Performing regular skylight maintenance can help you spot the warning signs early before the leaks become a major issue.

Another main concern is safe access to the skylight to clean and maintain it. High ceilings can be difficult to reach. Even with a ladder, you have a risk of falling when cleaning inside. Climbing on your roof to clean the exterior comes with an even bigger safety risk. Assess your ability to climb safely before undertaking the cleaning process yourself. Hiring a professional can be a safe alternative if you have any doubts about being able to do the job yourself.<br><iframe title="YouTube video player" width="1072" height="603" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-w93u9ICMks?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen title="Who the Heck Is HomeServe???"></iframe>
