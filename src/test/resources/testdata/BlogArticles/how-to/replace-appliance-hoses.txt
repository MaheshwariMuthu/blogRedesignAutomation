From refrigerators to gas grills and everything in between, here’s how to replace common appliance hoses and keep your home safe.

How Do You Replace the Hoses on Your Washer?
--------------------------------------------

When rubber washing machine hoses go bad, they can burst or split, allowing gallons of water to spill out in your laundry room. Inspect this hose regularly to look for blistering, worn spots and cracks. Even if you don't find signs of wear, replacing the washer hose every 5 years is a good idea. Consider upgrading to a steel braided hose, which is less likely to burst than rubber.

The cost to have a plumber replace the hose is around $150, according to the [Chicago Tribune](https://www.chicagotribune.com/real-estate/sns-201901241702--tms--doityrslmsdiy-b20190218-20190218-story.html). If you replace it yourself, expect to pay around $25 for the hoses.

Follow these steps:

1\. Shut off the water supply.

2\. Run the washing machine for a minute or two to drain water from the hoses.

3\. Unplug the washing machine.

4\. Position a bucket under the water supply point. Unscrew the hoses at the water supply line. Adjustable pliers can help loosen the hoses.

5\. Unscrew the other ends of the hoses where they connect to the washing machine.

6\. Screw the new hoses onto the washing machine. Tighten them with pliers.

7\. Screw the other end of each hose to the water supply and tighten them.

8\. Turn the water on and watch for leaks.

9\. Run the washing machine to check the connections.

How Do You Replace the Hose on Your Dryer?
------------------------------------------

Dryers don't have water hoses, but they do have vent hoses. Even though they don't leak like water hoses, they can be dangerous due to built-up lint that can catch on fire. Cleaning your dryer vent can help, but replacing the vent hose occasionally may also be necessary. The flexible ducting typically costs between 50 cents and $1 per foot, so says [This Old House](https://www.homeserve.com/en-us/blog/cost-guide/dryer-vent-installation/).

Follow these steps to replace your dryer’s hose:

1\. Slide the dryer out from the wall.

2\. Unplug the dryer.

3\. Loosen the hose clamps holding the hose to the dryer by unscrewing the screws. Pull the hose off at both ends.

4\. Place one end of the new hose onto the dryer flange. Position a clamp over it and tighten it.

5\. Seal around the connection point using foil duct tape.

6\. Stretch the hose up to the dryer vent pipe. Push the hose in place, extending it 2 inches (5 centimeters) onto the pipe. Cut the hose to length if needed.

7\. Attach a clamp to hold that end in place and seal it with duct tape.

8\. Plug the dryer in and slide it back into place.

How Do You Replace Your Fridge Hose?
------------------------------------

Refrigerators require a range of occasional maintenance, from cleaning the coils to replacing light bulbs. Something you might not think about is the water hose that connects to your fridge's water dispenser or icemaker. It can become pinched, clogged or damaged, which can cause leaks. You can replace it with another hose or use a steel braided water line for added strength. According to [Fixr](https://www.fixr.com/costs/ice-maker-repair), having the water line professionally repaired typically costs between $100 and $200. You can save on the labor costs by doing it yourself. Based on the prices of hoses listed on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Fridge-Water-Line/s?k=Fridge+Water+Line), you should be able to find parts for $10 to $30.

Here are the steps to replace it:

1\. Slide the refrigerator out and unplug it.

2\. Shut off the water supply.

3\. Loosen and remove the compression nuts on both ends of the hose. Remove the hose.

4\. Run the new hose along the same pathway. Connect it to the water supply and the refrigerator using compression nuts.

5\. Turn on the water and plug in the refrigerator to test the connection.

How Do You Replace the Your Dishwasher’s Hose?
----------------------------------------------

Another water hose that might need to be replaced to prevent leaks is your dishwasher hose. You might not notice the leaks immediately because all of the hoses are behind the dishwasher, which is surrounded by cabinets, so it’s best to be proactive. The cost of the replacement hose is usually between $10 and $20, according to [Thumbtack](https://www.thumbtack.com/p/dishwasher-repair-cost).

To replace the dishwasher hose, follow these steps:

1\. Shut off the power to the dishwasher. Turn off the water supply.

2\. Position a bucket under the sink where the dishwasher hose connects.

3\. Unhook the hose from the connection under the sink. It's usually connected with a worm clamp — which requires you to turn a nut or screw to loosen it — or a spring clip that you pinch to release.

4\. Unscrew the brackets that hold the dishwasher to the cabinets. Pull the dishwasher out from the cabinets.

5\. Find the other end of the hose, which connects to the dishwasher drain pump. This end of the hose typically uses the same type of attachment as the other end, so remove the worm clamp or spring clip to free the hose. There might also be a nut or other attachment method where the hose exits the dishwasher that you need to loosen or remove.

6\. Place the new hose first over the outlet on the dishwasher pump. Use a clamp or clip to hold it in place securely. Your dishwasher hose kit will likely come with them.

7\. Guide the hose out of the dishwasher and replace the nut at that location if there was one. Feed it through to the sink where the old hose was connected.

8\. Slide the dishwasher back into place.

9\. Reconnect the new hose the same way the old one was connected and secure it with the clamp or clip.

10\. Restore power and water to the unit. Test it out to ensure the hose isn't leaking.

How Do You Replace the Hose on Your Gas Grill?
----------------------------------------------

Gas grills need hoses to supply the propane to the burners. It's not always easy to tell if the hose is leaking, but it can be dangerous if the fuel leaks. You can check for leaks by mixing dish soap and water in a bottle and spraying it on the hose and connections. If you see bubbles, it's likely leaking. When you replace the hose, you also need to replace the regulator. [Consumer Reports](https://www.consumerreports.org/cro/news/2014/08/5-signs-your-gas-grill-is-over-the-hill/index.htm) says you should expect to pay $15 to $80 for the replacement parts.

Here's what to do:

1\. Shut off the gas.

2\. Unscrew the mounting nut at the burner assembly that holds the hose in place.

3\. Disconnect the regulator, which should be attached to the shut-off valve for the propane tank. It should unscrew.

4\. Screw the regulator on the new hose to the shut-off valve.

5\. Put the other end of the hose onto the gas nipple at the burner assembly and screw the mounting nut securely in place. Use an adjustable wrench to tighten it.

6\. Turn on the gas and check for leaks by spraying the connections with a soapy water mixture.
