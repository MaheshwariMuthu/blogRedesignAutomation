Save on Your Bathroom Remodel With These Tips
---------------------------------------------

Starting a bathroom remodeling project is exciting, but it can be costlier than it needs to be if you dive in without thinking everything through. To help you avoid unnecessary costs, let's look at 10 ways to save money without compromising on style or quality.

### 1\. Embrace the Power of Paint

Using only a brush, some paint and elbow grease, you can make your bathroom look and feel fresher. It's the most affordable option because you save on labor costs by doing the work yourself. There's no need to move plumbing, remove and replace fixtures or even hang a new shower curtain to get a fresh look. It's a good choice if you don't have a lot of money to spend.

### 2\. Salvage and Repurpose

Before driving to your local home improvement store, look at what you can reuse from your existing bathroom. Those cabinets could look new with some paint and different handles. The faucets might look great in your new sink or tub if you buff them up with some cleaning solution.

### 3\. DIY Magic

Another way to save money on a bathroom remodel is by doing it yourself. This can make the whole project considerably less expensive. Consider only hiring people to do the jobs you don't feel comfortable doing yourself. You can find plenty of free tutorials online to guide you through common tasks, such as tiling a shower or replacing a faucet. However, if it's something electrical, such as replacing light fixtures, make sure you follow all safety precautions, such as switching off your home's electricity supply.

### 4\. Shop Smart

If you're doing some DIY, you'll probably visit your local home improvement store for materials. If you're a savvy shopper, you can reduce your bathroom refit costs. Explore different suppliers and compare their prices for the same materials and see if they're having sales or offering discounts. Check out local salvage yards and second-hand stores for some bargains.

### 5\. Opt for Cost-Effective Flooring

Flooring can quickly eat up your budget, but there are more affordable options available. Consider vinyl or laminate flooring. Both are more cost-effective than tiles while still being durable and stylish. Check online and in local stores, and you'll find a wealth of designs.

### 6\. Revamp, Don't Replace

Tired-looking fixtures can get a new lease on life with a deep clean. Check online for ways to [remove stubborn stains](https://www.familyhandyman.com/project/how-to-clean-bathtub-stains/) from fixtures.

### 7\. Energy-Efficient Fixtures

New energy-efficient bathroom products are entering the market all the time. Check out the latest versions of low-flow toilets, water-saving showerheads and LED lighting. They'll reduce your environmental footprint, and they may even save you money in the long term.

### 8\. Don't Make Changes

Ask yourself if the toilet, sink, tub or shower really needs to be repositioned. Sometimes it's best not to make changes, especially when they'll involve additional pipework (which can be expensive to reroute). Consider not changing the bathroom's layout, even if you're replacing the fixtures.

### 9\. Focus on Small Changes

You don't need a complete overhaul for your bathroom to look new. An existing sink can look quite different simply by changing the faucets. Consider replacing the towel bars and showerhead, hanging a new shower curtain and sprucing up the walls with some decorative wall art. Fit solid surface panels made from acrylic or fiberglass to the shower walls instead of expensive tiles.

### 10\. Plan and Prioritize

You can save money on your bathroom remodel if you make a plan and prioritize your expenses. By identifying the key elements that will transform the room, you can avoid spending money on things that don't add value.
