Especially if you purchase a prefabricated kit, installing a porch swing is something you could conceivably do yourself in a weekend. Here, we break down the materials needed and the how-to of installing a porch swing.

First Things First: Measure
---------------------------

You need to have a certain amount of space on your porch in order to hang a swing. You should have 3 to 4 feet in front of and behind the swing so it can properly sway back and forth. You should also give yourself 2 feet on either side of the swing so you can walk around it.

Porch swings are fairly heavy. Add to that weight a couple of seated adults, and you’re going to want to make sure your porch can handle it. Check your beams and joists. If your porch ceiling is unfinished, this is easy. If it’s finished, you’ll need to remove the ceiling and see what kind of beams you have. A 2x8 beam can safely support the load, although a 2x6 can work as well.

If your beams are smaller or thinner, you'll need additional bolstering support. You should never install your swing’s supports in plywood or beadboard; it’s far too weak to support both the swing and a person sitting on it.

Next, you’ll need to figure out which way you’re going to face the swing. The most common orientation is to face it forward, towards your front yard. You may afford yourself a little more privacy if you position it to the side. If you have a wide porch, a sideways-facing swing will also allow you to create a comfortable space with additional seating.

Hardware
--------

If you are using a porch swing kit, all necessary hardware should be included. If you’ve built your porch swing or transformed a daybed or other piece of furniture into a swing, you’ll need to purchase the hardware. You can find porch swing hardware packs that should have everything you need.

You can use either metal chains or rope to suspend your swing. If you use rope, it should be braided nylon or polyester. Use either two or four hooks to hang the swing. Often two hooks are used with a chain that’s shaped like an upside-down Y. One part hangs from the hook, and the chain splits to connect to both the front and back of the swing. Using four hooks and four separate chains may give your swing more support, but this does require drilling four holes.

You also have a choice of fasteners. A base, hook and comfort spring are hangers that are made specifically for porch swings. Other options include eye bolts or S-hooks with 4- to 6-inch shafts.

The Swing
---------

What’s great about a porch swing is you can upcycle an old piece of furniture into your swing. Or, you can make it easy on yourself and simply purchase one. You may want a single chair or a bench. If you opt for a bench, plan for the swing to be 2 feet wide per person. A 4-foot bench can comfortably seat two adults. It’s not recommended to have a swing wider than 8 feet unless you have an extremely sturdy place to hang it.

Installation
------------

Now it’s time to hang your swing. The ceiling hooks should be installed 2 to 4 inches wider than the width of the entire swing. This will better distribute the weight and prevent the chains from rubbing against the swing. Drill pilot holes slightly smaller than your eye bolts. Next, screw the eye bolts into the center of your ceiling joists. You also want your swing to be at least 17 inches above the porch floor so your feet can rest comfortably when you’re sitting.

Once the eye bolts are installed, you can attach the chain or rope to the swing. The final step is to hang each side of your swing to the ceiling hooks. The most important thing to remember when installing a porch swing is strength and weight. The beam or joist that supports the swing’s hardware must be able to handle at least 500 pounds.

Once the swing is hung, brew up a pot of sweet tea, grab a book and a blanket and enjoy the fruits of your labor.
