If you let your oven go long enough without cleaning it, the inside winds up resembling something between a horrifying crime scene and one of those Magic Eye 3D paintings at the mall when you were a kid where if you looked close enough you could see a sailboat (it&#39;s a schooner!). We&#39;ve all been negligent at times. We&#39;re not proud of it. But now it&#39;s time to do something about it — before the &#39;90s shows up and asks for its op art back.

Ready to give your oven some overdue lovin&#39;? Read on to learn how to restore your oven to its O.G. interior glory.

If you&#39;re going the manual route, you either A) don&#39;t have an oven with a self-clean feature, B) are afraid self-clean&#39;s gonna burn the joint down, or C) are a stubborn skeptic who&#39;ll never be convinced that some fancified automated feature can do it as good as you and a little elbow grease. Whatever your case may be, rest assured, you&#39;ve got this!

Here are eight steps to an oven so clean you could eat off it … or, at least feel good about cooking in it:

## 1. Gather What You&#39;ll Need

For this job, you&#39;re going to need:

- Latex gloves
- Protective eyewear
- Quality [oven cleaner](https://www.amazon.com/pcr/Top-Rated-Household-Oven-Grill-Cleaners-Reviews/15524351011) found in most grocery stores
- A bucket lined with a garbage bag
- A pack of nonabrasive scrubbing pads or rags
- Newspapers

## 2. Prep the Area

Cleaning your oven can be a messy business. Lay down newspapers to protect your floor from falling filth as you clean, and make sure any items you don&#39;t want getting dirty are cleared away. (If you don&#39;t have newspapers, use old towels you don&#39;t mind ruining).

## 3. Remove the Racks

Take the racks out of the oven and set them aside on your newspaper.

## 4. Cover It in Cleaner

While wearing the gloves, spray a liberal amount of cleaner inside the oven and on the racks. (If you prefer, you can use baking soda, instead, as it acts as an effective mild abrasive.)

## 5. Hurry Up and Wait

Follow the manufacturer&#39;s instructions on how long you should let the cleaner sit and do its stuff. That&#39;s typically going to be 20-30 minutes for a normal amount of buildup. Take care to avoid spraying the burners and electrical elements as much as possible.

## 6. Start Scrubbin&#39;

After the recommended wait is over, it&#39;s time to do the dirty work of scrubbing away the grime using your scrubbing pads. Using non-abrasive scrubbing pads will ensure that grime comes off but your oven&#39;s interior remains intact.

## 7. Wipe It All Away

Use a rag to wipe off excess cleaner until it&#39;s all gone. You can toss our soiled rags and newspapers in the bucket as you work your way through the oven, adding fresh newspaper to the floor as needed.

## 8. Back to the Racks

Repeat the steps for your oven racks if you&#39;d like to clean those, as well, then replace them in the oven when you&#39;re through.

And there ya have it: Like it never happened. (We won&#39;t tell if you don&#39;t.) You may resume baking, broiling and roasting, like the definitely-not-negligent homeowner you are.
