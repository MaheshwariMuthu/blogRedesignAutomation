## How to Clean a Jetted Tub

All bathtubs need a regular scrubbing, but jetted bathtubs take extra time and effort. If you use bubble bath regularly, it’s extremely important to clean a jetted tub until you’re able to run the jets on high and the water runs cleanly. So, get out your latex gloves and get ready to clean the crevices, the different components, and those hidden and difficult-to-reach areas. This do-it-yourself project offers a great reward for your hard work: a luxurious whirlpool bath to relax in and forget your troubles.

### Cleaning Products and Tools 

It’s important to keep cleaning products and tools handy to regularly wash your jetted tub. When it comes to choosing jetted-tub cleaners, you have a few options, and most of them can be found in your pantry or under your sink: vinegar, baking soda, detergents, bleach and borax.

#### Tools

- Cleaning rags
- A toothbrush
- A measuring cup

#### Cleaning Products

- Vinegar
- Baking Soda
- Powdered dishwashing detergent

## How to Clean Bathtub Jets: 6 Steps

1. After wiping the tub free of hair or debris, fill the tub with hot water 3 inches above the jets. If it’s been a long time since you’ve done a thorough cleaning, it's important that the water be as hot as possible.

2. Once the tub is full of hot water, there are several cleaning solution options. Choose one of the following agents and add to the hot water:

    - 2 cups of white vinegar: Vinegar is acidic, so it's an effective choice because it removes built-up grime without the corrosive effects of other cleansers.
    - 1/2 cup bleach and 2 tablespoons of liquid or powdered dishwashing detergent: You may want to refer to the manufacturer's instructions before using bleach, as it might dry out the tub's gaskets over time.
    - 1/2 cup bleach with Borax sprinkled over the water is effective to counteract a build-up of mold.
    - Use a commercial brand cleaner specifically for jetted bathtubs and follow its instructions.

3. Now that you’ve selected your cleaning agent, turn off the air induction valves unless the manufacturer's instructions advise otherwise. This will force the water to circulate through the internal plumbing of the tub, ensuring a concentrated flow of water and resulting in a deeper cleaning. Turn the jets on high and run them for 10 to 15 minutes, or until debris quits spewing out of the jets.

4. After running the jets for the recommended time, turn them off and drain the water from the tub. Now you want to flush the jets one more time. Again, fill the tub with water (cold water is fine for this purpose) 3 inches above the jets, as this cycle is the cleaning water for your jets. Run the jets on high 15 minutes.

5. After thoroughly cleaning the pipes and jets of mildew, bacteria and other soap scum, it's time to give the tub a good old-fashioned scrubbing. Put on your latex gloves, grab your soft washcloths and baking soda, and get to work.

    Baking soda is a gentle, natural cleanser that should be safe for acrylic, so you don’t have to worry about scratching the surface. Generously sprinkle baking soda over the entire surface of the tub, including the faucet and drain, and let it sit for a few minutes. Backing soda is excellent for removing soap scum, mildew stains and mold, so using your soft cloth, gently scrub the entire surface of the tub and then rinse it with water.

6. Now, grab that toothbrush dedicated to cleaning household items, and scrub the inside of the bathtub jets and the molding around them. Also, unscrew the intake valve cover and clean that with the toothbrush. Then, rinse it with water, and voila! Your jetted tub is squeaky clean and ready for use.

## How Often Should You Clean Your Jetted Tub?

The frequency of deep cleaning your jetted tub depends on how often you use it. If you use your tub routinely for bubble bath soaks, you should deep clean it monthly. If you use it sporadically, you should clean it every two to three months.
