There are a few golden rules to keep in mind when cleaning your quartz counters. Here’s what you need to know.

What Shouldn’t You Use on Quartz Countertops?
---------------------------------------------

Like granite countertops, quartz countertops get along best with nonabrasive cleaners. The most important rule when cleaning is to stay away from harsh chemicals. In most cases, identifying the best cleaner for quartz countertops is simple: Soap and warm water will do the trick.

### Can You Use Clorox Wipes on Quartz Countertops?

If you're wondering how to disinfect quartz countertops, you may be curious if Clorox or other wipes are safe to use. Disinfecting wipes may contain harsh chemicals such as bleach, so it’s best to avoid them unless you are certain the wipes won't damage the countertop. If you have doubts about a specific product, you may be able to get in touch with the manufacturer or installer of your countertop to ask if it is safe to use.

How to Clean Quartz Countertops
-------------------------------

Another important rule for quartz countertops is to never let spills linger. Instead, Bob Vila recommends using [mild dish soap and a cloth](https://www.bobvila.com/articles/how-to-clean-quartz-countertops/) to clean up new spills promptly. That, combined with warm water, should help ward off stains. If a spill does have a chance to dry or if tough stains form, you can use glass or surface cleaners with a nonabrasive sponge. If grease is an issue, use [degreaser](https://www.wikihow.com/Clean-Quartz-Countertops).

Be sure to check under countertop items like coffee makers, kettles and other appliances for spillage that may otherwise go unnoticed. Don't forget to clean the backsplash.

### How Do You Keep Quartz Countertops Shiny?

Use a cutting board rather than cutting directly on the counter’s surface. This will protect your quartz from scratches, which can make it appear dull. Also, avoid placing hot objects on quartz surfaces, as they aren't heat resistant. When cleaning, never use rough implements like scouring pads as these may cause scratches, too.

### Can I Use Magic Erasers on Quartz Countertops?

[Magic Erasers](https://www.mrclean.com/en-us/shop-products/magic-erasers) are typically safe for quartz countertops. They are particularly useful for wine stains, and they can also remove the rings that glasses leave behind.
