Wallpaper removal can be a tedious and time-consuming task, but it’s an easier job than you might think — especially since there are multiple ways to do it. So, if you’re ready to ditch your old wallpaper to give your walls a much-needed facelift, read on to learn some of the best methods.

Before You Begin
----------------

### Determine What Type of Wallpaper You Have

There are three main types of wallpaper, and the type you have will determine the method you should use to remove it.

* **Removable wallpaper:** As the name implies, removable wallpaper is designed to be temporarily installed and easily removed. In most cases, removable wallpaper can simply be peeled off of the wall. To determine if you have this type of wallpaper, try prying off one of the wallpaper’s corners with a putty knife. If it comes loose easily, try peeling it off the wall. If it comes off easily, you can be sure you have removable wallpaper. Continue peeling off the wallpaper until it’s completely removed from the wall.
* **Strippable wallpaper:** Strippable wallpaper is similar to removable wallpaper, in that it was designed to be temporarily installed and relatively easy to remove. However, it usually needs to be soaked with warm water prior to removal. You can test to see if you have strippable wallpaper by soaking a corner with water, allowing it to sit for a few minutes and then trying to scrape it off with a putty knife. If it comes off easily, you have strippable wallpaper and can continue soaking and scraping until it’s completely removed from the wall.
* **Vinyl wallpaper:** Vinyl wallpaper is designed to be permanent, waterproof and washable. Consequently, it’s the most difficult to remove and will require one of the methods outlined below.

### Prepare the Room

Regardless of the method you use, removing wallpaper is a messy job. Remove everything from the walls (like pictures and vent covers), cover furniture and put down drop cloths. To protect your baseboards, use painter’s tape to fix the outside edges of the drop cloths to the top edges of the baseboards. Finally, completely cover all the electrical outlets on the wall with painter’s tape.

How to Remove Wallpaper
-----------------------

### Method 1: Wallpaper Steamer

A wallpaper steamer is arguably the easiest and most effective method for removing even the most stubborn wallpaper. Wallpaper steamers are somewhat expensive to purchase, but they can be rented on a daily basis for a reasonable price from many equipment rental and home improvement stores.

#### Things You’ll Need

*   Wallpaper steamer
*   Water
*   Wallpaper scoring tool (optional)
*   Two sponges
*   Wide putty knife

#### Step 1: Prepare the Steamer

Pour water into the steamer’s reservoir until it reaches the “fill” line. Plug the steamer’s power cord into the nearest electrical outlet and wait for it to warm up. Most steamers have an indicator light that informs you when the water is sufficiently heated, which usually takes between five and 10 minutes.

#### Step 2: Score the Wallpaper (Optional)

As you’re waiting for the steamer to heat up, score the wallpaper with a wallpaper scoring tool to allow the steam to penetrate behind the wallpaper and soften the adhesive. Use the scoring tool across the entire surface of the wallpaper using a circulation motion, being careful not to use so much pressure that you damage the drywall. Scoring the wallpaper may not be entirely necessary when using a wallpaper steamer, but it can greatly reduce the amount of time and effort required during the next step.

#### Step 3: Steam and Scrape

Once the steamer is ready, and the wallpaper has been scored, place the steamer plate against the wallpaper and release the steam by pressing the trigger. Hold the plate over a single area of wallpaper for about 15 to 20 seconds, then remove the plate from the wall.

Immediately begin scraping off the wallpaper with a wide putty knife, being careful not to apply so much pressure that you damage the drywall. If the wallpaper is too difficult to scrape off, apply steam to the area for another 15 to 20 seconds before trying to scrape it again. Repeat these steps until the wallpaper is completely removed from the wall.

#### Step 4: Clean Up

With the wallpaper removed, clean off any residual adhesive from the wall with a damp sponge. If the adhesive is too dry to remove with the sponge, apply steam to the area until it softens up enough to sponge off.

Afterward, use a new damp sponge to wipe down the wall.

### Method 2: Wallpaper Stripper

Wallpaper strippers use chemical agents to soften wallpaper adhesive in order to separate it from the wall. Wallpaper strippers are available in both liquid- and gel-based varieties. Liquid strippers can more rapidly cover a larger surface area than gel-based strippers, but liquid strippers tend to be messier and may drip onto the floor or other surrounding surfaces. In addition, gel strippers are best for wallpaper installed over unprimed drywall since the gel more effectively softens the adhesive without saturating — and possibly damaging — the drywall.

#### Things You’ll Need

*   Liquid or gel wallpaper stripper
*   Wide putty knife
*   Two sponges
*   Water

#### Step 1: Score the Wallpaper

Use a wallpaper scoring tool to score the wallpaper to allow the stripper to soften the wallpaper’s adhesive. Use the tool in a circular motion. Be careful not to use too much pressure, which can scratch and damage the wall underneath.

#### Step 2: Spray & Scrape the Wallpaper

Spray the stripper onto a roughly 2-foot by 2-foot section of wallpaper, then use a sponge to evenly distribute the stripper. Allow the stripper to soak into the wallpaper for the amount of time recommended by the manufacturer — usually around two minutes. Once the wallpaper has softened, use a putty knife to scrape off that section of wallpaper. Continue this process until all the wallpaper has been removed.

#### Step 3: Clean the Walls

With the wallpaper removed, clean off any residual adhesive from the wall with a damp sponge. If the adhesive is too dry to remove, spray it with the stripper and wait for it to soften up, then wipe it up with the sponge.

Then, switch to a new sponge, dampen it and use it to wipe down the wall.

### Method 3: Vinegar or Fabric Softener

Wallpaper can also be removed with materials you already have lying around your house, like vinegar or fabric softener. Although these materials may not be as effective as a commercial wallpaper stripper, they’re excellent alternatives if you would rather not apply wallpaper stripper onto your walls.

#### Things You’ll Need

*   Measuring cup
*   Spray bottle
*   White vinegar or fabric softener
*   Water
*   Wallpaper scoring tool (optional)
*   Putty knife
*   Sponge
*   Water

#### Step 1: Mix the Solution

If you’re using vinegar, mix equal parts white vinegar and warm water in a spray bottle. For fabric softener, mix one part softener with four parts warm water in a spray bottle. Mix thoroughly.

#### Step 2: Score the Wallpaper (Optional)

Use a wallpaper scoring tool to score the wallpaper to allow the vinegar or softener solution to get behind the wallpaper. Apply the scoring across the entire surface of the wallpaper using a circulation motion, being careful not to use too much pressure, as that can scratch and damage the wall. Scoring the wallpaper isn’t necessary when using vinegar or fabric softener as an agent to loosen the wallpaper, but it may help make the next step easier.

#### Step 3: Spray and Scrape

Spray the wallpaper with the solution until it’s completely saturated. Let it rest on the wallpaper for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the wallpaper starts to separate from the wall. Use a putty knife to carefully scrape off the wallpaper, being careful not to apply so much pressure that you damage the drywall. Continue until all the wallpaper is removed.

#### Step 4: Clean Up

With the wallpaper removed, clean off any residual adhesive from the wall with a damp sponge. Some of the adhesive may be too dry to remove. Just spray it with the stripper and wait for it to soften up, then wipe it up with the sponge. Use a damp sponge (a new one) to wipe down the wall.<br><iframe title="YouTube video player" width="1072" height="603" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-w93u9ICMks?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen title="Who the Heck Is HomeServe???"></iframe>
