According to the Austin, Texas-based [manufacturer](https://jimcolamp.com/accent-table-recall-notice), an electrical issue affects the tables’ USB charging ports and “convenience charging receptacles” for AC and DC electricity. The polarity of the charging receptacles or ports may reverse, posing a risk of electrical shock.

The recall, announced Feb. 17, affects units in several styles and colors. They were sold with tags marked “J Hunt Home” or “J Hunt & Co.” The recalled tables have date codes between April 2019 and November 2020. To see if your unit has been recalled, you can check your item number against [this list](https://jimcolamp.com/accent-table-recall-notice) on the manufacturer’s website. The item number and date code are listed on a white label on the back or bottom of the table.

According to the [Consumer Product Safety Commission](https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2021/Jimco-Lamps-Recalls-Accent-Tables-with-Charging-Receptacles-Due-to-Shock-Hazard), no incidents or injuries have been reported. The accent tables were manufactured in China, and sold online at Amazon.com and in HomeGoods, T.J.Maxx, Marshalls and other stores, priced between $60 and $130. About 11,000 additional units were [sold in Canada](https://www.healthycanadians.gc.ca/recall-alert-rappel-avis/hc-sc/2021/74903r-eng.php).

If your accent table has been affected by this recall, stop using the charging ports immediately, unplug the unit and contact the manufacturer for a refund or replacement.
