If you’re curious about how to keep your manufactured home in good condition through preventative maintenance and regular check-ins, you’re in the right place.

How Does a Manufactured Home Differ From a Traditional House in Terms of Home Maintenance?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As with other homes, regular maintenance is key to keeping your manufactured home safe and free from damage. It can also save you money by preventing bigger problems later down the line. That said, a checklist for a manufactured home is a bit different from that of other homes. The good news is that the checklist for manufactured home maintenance is pretty straightforward and not too overwhelming. By adding just a handful of regular tasks to your semi-annual checklists, you can help ensure your manufactured home is in good shape and ready to withstand whatever weather or temperature fluctuations the seasons might bring.

Maintenance Tasks for Manufactured Homes
----------------------------------------

Although you can technically conduct mobile or manufactured home maintenance most any time of the year, fall and spring are great times to plan on giving your house the once over. By checking on your home in early fall before the temperatures drop, you can make sure your manufactured home will stay warm in the winter. Another check after the last frost in spring is wise to inspect for any winter storm damage and to make sure your home is ready from spring showers and the summer heat.

### Gutters

As with any home, you want to make sure your manufactured home’s gutters are clean and flowing free throughout the year, so that they can do their job properly and divert water, snow, and debris away from your home. Checking gutters before winter will ensure they’re not clogged with too many leaves and twigs, which can cause ice dams in winter. Similarly, a check-in during early spring will ensure your gutters are in good shape for channeling those spring showers away from your house, helping to protect from water damage.

### Siding

When it comes to mobile and manufactured homes, checking your siding should be a regular part of your maintenance checklist. Plan on inspecting for damage after any summer storms or heavy winter weather, too. Walk the perimeter of your home and inspect to make sure there’s no damaged vinyl or hardboard siding. You’ll also want to check the skirting to ensure none of it is damaged or missing. While manufactured homes do need to be properly ventilated around the skirting, cracks or holes in your skirting can allow excess moisture and critters in — neither of which you want under your home!

### Roofing

A quick inspection of your roof should be enough to determine whether you have any damaged or missing shingles. You should also check your flashing and roof caulking while you’re at it. Imperfections in your roof can allow water into the home, which can cause significant damage if it’s not dealt with quickly. You may also want to reseal or recoat your manufactured home’s roof, particularly if it has a flat roof. This roof coating is key to regulating indoor temps and keeping your home protected from moisture.

### Foundation

Check that your manufactured home’s foundation or support is in good condition and free of cracks or any damage that may have occurred from settling. While some settling for manufactured homes is expected, you want to make sure your home is settling levelly in a way that’s not damaging your foundation — especially if the home has only been in its current location for a year or two. Foundation issues can cause a host of other problems with your manufactured home, so keeping an eye on the condition of your foundation is key.

### Windows

When it comes to windows, the good news is that many mobile home windows are designed to be more energy-efficient than regular windows. Still, warm weather and humidity can cause your mobile home’s windows to swell, so you’ll want to check their functionality seasonally by opening them and checking for any gaps or cracks. As you inspect your windows, also check their seals to make sure everything seems secure to prevent drafts or leakage. You don’t want warm air sneaking out in the winter or cold air coming in.

Prevention Is Key
