If your iron could use a little TLC, read on.

How to Clean the Bottom of an Iron
----------------------------------

The bottom of an iron is called a soleplate. An iron’s bottom can become scorched or burned. A sticky residue may be left after craft projects or from mineral deposits that build up after using the steam function. Many household items can be used to clean the bottom of your iron, and these cleaning tips take less than 15 minutes. For these methods (unless otherwise stated), ensure your iron is off, unplugged and completely cool.

### Easy Clean

For a general clean, try this: Mix equal parts white vinegar and water. Use a soft cloth to wipe the iron bottom. If you have deposits on the soleplate, baking soda may come to your rescue. Create a mixture of 1 tablespoon of water and 2 tablespoons of baking soda. Wipe this thick paste onto the deposits and let it sit for a few minutes. Wipe clean with a damp cloth.

### Try Toothpaste

Toothpaste can do the same work. Put toothpaste directly onto the dirty or brown spots and leave it to sit for a minute or so. Clean the toothpaste off with a damp cloth.

### Nail Tough Stains

Nail polish remover is another to have in your iron cleaning arsenal. This method requires the iron to be on, so wear oven mitts or something else to protect your hands. If you have some residue on the bottom of the iron, nail polish remover may get rid of it. While the iron is on and hot, dip a cotton ball in nail polish remover and wipe the dirty bits. Let the iron cool, then wipe any remaining polish off with a damp cloth. Do this in a well-ventilated area so the fumes don't affect anyone.

### Use Dryer Sheets

Alternatively, with the iron set at low, wipe the iron bottom with new dryer sheets. Gently scrub until clean. You may need a few sheets if your iron has tough spots.

### Newspaper-and-Salt Method

If your iron is sticky, use salt and newspaper. Sprinkle a large amount of salt over a piece of newspaper. Turn the iron on and “iron” the newspaper in all directions until the sticky stuff is gone. Let the iron cool, and then wipe away any excess salt. If it looks like some salt got into the steam vents, use a cotton swab to remove the grains.

### Erase Mistakes

A Magic Eraser also works well on sticky spots and scorch marks. Use firm pressure to wipe down the bottom of the iron and a bit of extra pressure on the stubborn areas.

### Get Melted Plastic Off

Did your iron come into contact with plastic, and now you’ve got melted, hardened plastic on the bottom of your iron? No worries, we can take care of that too. If the plastic is still soft, fill a metal bowl or pan with ice and place your iron on top of the cubes. Wait about 10 minutes until the plastic is hardened, then scrape it off with a plastic knife. _Beware!_ Only use a blunt plastic knife here. A metal or other sharp tool can scratch or damage the soleplate.

### If All Else Fails…

Commercial iron cleaners are also available if none of these tricks are cleaning the bottom of your iron. Be sure to follow the directions carefully so you don’t damage the iron.

How to Clean an Iron’s Steam Vents
----------------------------------

Mineral deposits can form inside steam vents. This can make your iron’s steam function inefficient, and it can also leave deposits on your clothing. Cotton swabs and white vinegar are all you need to clean the steam vents of an iron. When your iron is cool, simply dip a cotton swab in vinegar and wipe it into and around the steam hole. You may need to rotate the swab several times to break up the deposits.

How to Clean an Iron’s Water Reservoir
--------------------------------------

Our trusty friend vinegar can do double-duty in cleaning your iron’s water reservoir and steam vents. Simply fill the reservoir with a mix of half vinegar and half water. Then, take an old towel and steam-iron it. The steamed vinegar will clean out both the vents and reservoir. Be sure no vinegar mixture is left in the reservoir before your next ironing.

After cleaning your iron bottom and before ironing some clothes, iron an old towel or sheet (something you don’t mind getting ruined) to ensure all cleaning substances have been removed.<br><iframe title="YouTube video player" width="1072" height="603" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/E7N374KASqs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen title="Eco-friendly laundry hack!"></iframe>
