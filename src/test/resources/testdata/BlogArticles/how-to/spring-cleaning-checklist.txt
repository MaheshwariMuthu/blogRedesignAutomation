  The days are finally starting to get longer and warmer after a cold, dark winter. It’s the perfect time to throw open the windows and revitalize your home for the new season.  No wonder “spring cleaning” is a perennial phenomenon among homeowners!

Actually, according to the [Cleaning Authority,](https://www.thecleaningauthority.com/blog/home-life/why-is-spring-cleaning-important-/) spring cleaning has been around for a long time. When houses were heated by fires, they had to be tightly sealed to keep the heat inside. You can imagine that the lack of airflow led to a buildup of soot, dirt and dust. So in the spring, people quite literally opened their windows to the fresh air for the first time in months.

You can channel this energy by thoroughly cleaning one area, one room or your entire home this month. Spring’s the perfect time to get done those tasks you wouldn’t ordinarily do during a normal house-cleaning sesh — like flipping the mattresses, defrosting the freezer and washing the walls.

How Long Does Spring Cleaning Take?
-----------------------------------

Proper planning makes for faster cleaning, and two solid days of work should be enough to complete a total-home refresh. An ideal time for spring cleaning is over a clear weekend. However, if it's too difficult to find a free block of time, you can divide the list into distinct parts and tackle it over a longer period. If you’re only looking to spruce up a room or two, you can simply use a free afternoon.

Cleaning Products You’ll Need
-----------------------------

Before you begin, make sure you have everything you need. To avoid harsh products, consider making your own cleaning products from natural ingredients. It's also helpful to invest in a cleaning caddy to carry your supplies from room to room. Here’s what you may need for a small tidy-up or whole-house cleaning:

*   Vacuum and dusters
*   Dustpan and brush
*   Mop and bucket
*   Squeegee
*   Dish soap
*   Window spray
*   Multi-surface cleaner
*   Disinfecting spray
*   Furniture polish
*   Wood cleaner
*   White vinegar
*   Baking soda
*   Oven cleaner
*   Garbage bags
*   Microfiber cloths, scourers and sponges
*   Scrubbing brush
*   Plastic gloves

Where Should You Start With Spring Cleaning?
--------------------------------------------

One of the great things about this annual deep clean is that it gives you a great opportunity to declutter your space. Prior to cleaning, your first step should be to remove any unused items so you can clean your home more effectively.

What Are Some Methods of Decluttering and Organization?
-------------------------------------------------------

Go through all the areas of the house where you may find expired products. This includes the fridge, pantry, freezer, bathroom cabinets and cosmetics in the bedroom. Find anything that is expired and throw it away.

Move on to the remaining items. A good rule of thumb is to keep only what you have used in the past year. Go through each room (don't forget the garage) to create a pile of items that you haven't used. Donate what you can and dispose of the rest responsibly.

Clear up more space by digitizing important papers and documents. Be sure to shred sensitive documents before discarding them.

Now that you have gotten rid of what you don't need, organize every drawer, cabinet and dresser, creating a specific place for each item.

Moving on to Cleaning
---------------------

After decluttering, the next step on the spring cleaning checklist is dusting. Check all unused spaces, such as the top of high furniture and display cases. Remember to remove dust from light fixtures, lamps and ceiling fans, too. Clean all visible furniture surfaces with multi-surface cleaner, disinfectant or furniture polish.

Follow this by [washing the windows](https://www.homeserve.com/en-us/blog/how-to/clean-windows/), windowsills, walls and baseboards. Bunched-up newspaper can be a great way to leave a streak-free shine on your windows. Remove curtains to launder them and dust blinds. Many [wall stains can be removed](https://www.homeserve.com/en-us/blog/how-to/clean-walls/) with warm water, but be sure to check that cleaning will not damage the paint or wallpaper.

Next, follow the deep cleaning house checklist featured below to cover the detailed house cleaning tasks required in each room.

Finish up by cleaning the floors of your home. For carpeting, vacuum the floors and follow this by shampooing the carpet. Make sure your [vacuum cleaner is ready](https://www.homeserve.com/en-us/blog/how-to/clean-vacuum/) to tackle your spring cleaning tasks. Another great way to remove hair and dust embedded in a carpet is to run a squeegee across it. You will be surprised at how much can get trapped in there over time. Mop hardwood and tiled floors after vacuuming or sweeping.
