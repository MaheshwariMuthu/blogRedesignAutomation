Like the lungs and trachea in your body, the air ducts in your home are what allows it to “breathe,” enabling air to pass in and out of your house. The air conditioning and the heating systems also run through these air ducts. And not unlike how you cough to clear out your congested respiratory system, your home’s air ducts sometimes need to be cleared of dirt, impurities and other things that don’t belong there.
