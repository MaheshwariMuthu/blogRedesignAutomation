Let us start by saying that the best way to keep the inside of your microwave clean is to keep the food you&#39;re heating or reheating covered, and to do a quick wipedown with a damp sponge after each use — and let us follow up by saying, _Ha!_ Yeah, we know as well as you do that such clean-as-you-go initiative is uncommon to nonexistent, especially if you have kids. But what you _can_ do is know the best ways to remove (without a hammer and chisel) all those burnt-to-cinder splotches of spaghetti sauce and exploded bits of ground beef left over from Taco Tuesday when you absolutely _must_ clean the inside of your microwave because company&#39;s coming over.

But beyond your fear of being clean shamed by your dinner guests, proper maintenance is key to a long and useful life for any household appliance, including your microwave — and, let&#39;s face it, you cook with it more than you do your stove. To that end, here are four tried-and-true methods for deep cleaning your microwave:

## 1. The Vinegar Method

- Add 2 cups of water, 2 tablespoons of vinegar and one drop of lemon essential oil to a bowl.
- Microwave it for 5 minutes.
- Leave it closed up inside for 3 minutes before opening the door.
- The dirt and grime will be steam-softened and should wipe away easily with a paper towel, sponge or rag.

## 2. The Lemon Method

- Squeeze two lemon halves into half a cup of water, and drop the whole lemon halves into the water, too.
- Microwave it for 3 minutes, then let it sit closed up for 5 minutes.
- _Voila!_ Wipe everything down — easy peasy lemon squeezy.

## 3. The Sponge Method

This one comes courtesy of the makers of Simple Green all-purpose cleaner:

- Soak a clean sponge with fresh water, making sure it&#39;s as saturated as possible.
- Place the sponge in a microwave-safe bowl and microwave it on high for 2 minutes, and the steam created by heating the sponge will soften and loosen caked-on grime.
- Let the sponge sit in the microwave for a couple more minutes after that, until the warm water is cool enough to handle.
- Carefully remove the bowl and rinse the sponge, squeeze out some of the water and wipe down the microwave surfaces.

## 4. The <span class="capitalize">Mr. Clean</span> Method

Actually, you can name this one after whatever your household&#39;s all-purpose cleaner of choice is: The [Simple Green](https://simplegreen.com/products/all-purpose-cleaner/) Method, The [Fantastik](https://www.grainger.com/product/FANTASTIK-All-Purpose-Cleaner-and-Disinfectant-32GR63?ef_id=EAIaIQobChMI-87o54uu7QIVUeDICh2R3Qc0EAAYASAAEgKSwvD_BwE:G:s&amp;s_kwcid=AL!2966!3!431286693298!b!!g!!&amp;gucid=N:N:PS:Paid:GGL:CSM-2296:9JMEDM:20500731) Method … The [_Method_](https://methodhome.com/product-category/home-cleaning/) Method. Anyway, if there are still stubborn spots, you can use an all-purpose cleaner to cut through the grease and grime. Just be sure to go back over it with a clean, damp sponge or cloth afterwards, and again with a dry cloth or paper towel.

## More Tips

- [ Simple Green recommends](https://simplegreen.com/cleaning-tips/rooms/kitchen/microwaves/) removing the tray inside your microwave and, if possible, the rotating rack it sits on.
- Wash those pieces as you would normally, rinse them and allow them to dry.
- Place the clean, dry rack and tray back inside the microwave.
- Let everything air dry completely by leaving the microwave door open for an hour after you finish cleaning.
- Clean the _outside_ of the microwave by generously spraying your cleaning solution onto a sponge and wiping down the exterior surfaces; follow up with a clean, damp cloth, then dry with a dry cloth or paper towels, or let air dry.
