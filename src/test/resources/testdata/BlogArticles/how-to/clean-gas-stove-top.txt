Cooking is messy business — fat spitting out of frying pans, pots boiling over, food falling off the spoon as you serve... Before you know it, there’s grime everywhere. Wiping surfaces with a dishcloth is a good temporary solution, but what about deep cleaning? How do you clean a gas stovetop when the dirt seems to be permanently encrusted?

It’s a task we all want to put off for another day. But when the whole surface of your gas stovetop is sticky to the touch, it’s definitely time to do something about it.

Here’s our handy step-by-step guide to get your stovetop looking like new.

-------------------------------------------

Use Precautions
---------------

Before trying to clean gas range, make sure the surface has cooled completely. Ensure all the knobs are in the off position. As you’ll be removing the burners and grates, it’s a good idea to shut off the gas valve if possible. Gas safety is a priority, and you don’t want to accidentally switch anything on while cleaning.

Take Apart Your Stove
---------------------

A deep clean of a gas stovetop is going to require you to tackle each of the parts individually. Luckily, that’s easy to do. Start with these steps:

1.  Lift off the grates.
2.  Remove the burner caps and carefully pick up the gas stove burners themselves.
3.  Place everything in a bowl or the kitchen sink and cover with hot water.
4.  Add a few drops of dish soap and leave them to soak.
5.  Rinse with warm water, then air dry them or dry with dish towels.

Time to Roll Up Your Sleeves
----------------------------

Now that all the parts are removed and soaking, you can start on the stovetop itself.

Using a dry cloth, gently remove any dried food deposits from the surface. To tackle stuck-on grime:

1.  Spray the surface with a mixture of dish detergent and water. Leave it for a few minutes.
2.  Use a damp cloth or soft scouring pad to gently remove any stubborn grease or burnt-on food.
3.  Wipe down the stovetop with a paper towel or clean cloth to take away the dirt.
4.  Give the surface a final polish.

### Scrub With an Old Toothbrush

You may find areas where a damp cloth just doesn’t seem to be working. Try using a toothbrush instead. They’re gentle enough so as not to scratch your stovetop, but abrasive enough to lift off stubborn stains. This can be a slow process and one which may need repeating.

### Consider Stronger Options

Dish soap and detergent are not always strong enough to get the job done, especially if your range has been neglected for long time. There are plenty of gas stove cleaners and degreasers on the market to help make life easier: Easy-Off, Goo Gone, Krud Kutter and more.

How to Clean Gas Stove Grates
-----------------------------

If you find that the grates are still sticky to the touch, you might want to consider spraying them with a degreaser to help move things along. If you do, rinse them again before giving them a good scrub with a rough nylon brush.

How to Clean Gas Stove Burners
------------------------------

The burners are much more delicate than the grates and should never be treated with any harsh chemicals, including degreaser. Instead, use hot water and a nylon brush or scouring pad to gradually remove burnt-on dirt.

Once everything is clean and dry, reassemble your gas stovetop.

How to Clean a Gas Stovetop With Natural Ingredients
----------------------------------------------------

Chemical cleaners are not the only solutions. If you prefer using natural products, you can make your own cleaner with ingredients you probably already have in your kitchen cupboard. Baking soda and vinegar are a classic cleaning combo that can be effective in removing grease.

1.  Create a mixture of equal parts white vinegar and water.
2.  Soak the grates in it for at least 30 minutes.
3.  Use the same mixture on the burners and burner caps. Don’t soak them. Instead, use a spray bottle to apply the solution. Set those aside for 20 minutes.
4.  Rinse everything.
5.  Mix a paste of water and baking soda and apply it to the grates, burners and caps.
6.  Let sit for 30 minutes. Then use a brush or toothbrush to scrub off the hardened baking soda mixture.
7.  Dry all elements before putting your stovetop back together.

Make Cleaning a Habit
---------------------

According to [CNET](https://www.cnet.com/how-to/how-to-fix-a-gas-stove-that-wont-light/), one of the most common causes of gas range issues is a buildup of food debris and grease. Crumbs can affect the burner ignition or clog up vents in the burner itself, causing an irregular flame. As with other household maintenance tasks, cleaning your stove should become a regular chore to help prevent problems from occurring.

Best practice is to remove the grates and wipe down the surface after every use — even if it means giving it a quick clean multiple times a day.
