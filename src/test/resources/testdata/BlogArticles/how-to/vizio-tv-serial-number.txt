*   Press the menu button on your Vizio remote.
*   Select “Help” or “System.”
*   Select “System Information.”

Your Vizio TV serial number will be listed as “TV SN.”

### Use the SmartCast App

Finally, if you have [Vizio's SmartCast app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vizio.vue.launcher&hl=en_US&gl=US), you can use it to obtain the serial number. Turn on your TV, open the SmartCast app on your phone and select the name of your TV from the menu. Touch the gear icon to access the settings menu, select “System” and then “System Information” to see your serial number.

What’s the Difference Between a Serial Number and a Model Number?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

A serial number identifies your individual TV. No two Vizio TVs have the same serial number. A model number, on the other hand, provides general information about the TV, including its features, how old it is and where it was manufactured. Many TVs have the same model number, so it's important not to confuse the model and serial numbers.<br><iframe title="YouTube video player" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qpoqCRPHjqE" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
