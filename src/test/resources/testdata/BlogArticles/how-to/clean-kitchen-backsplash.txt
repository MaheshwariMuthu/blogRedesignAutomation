The good news is that learning how to clean the backsplash in your kitchen is quick and easy. Here’s what to do.

What Cleaner Should You Use on a Tile Backsplash?
-------------------------------------------------

The first step is to determine which type of kitchen tile cleaner is best for your backsplash. Start by checking the manufacturer's instructions for your specific type of backsplash tile to see if there are any cleaners that are recommended or not recommended. Additionally, you always want to test any type of cleaner on a small, inconspicuous spot to ensure it doesn’t cause damage or discoloration.

You can often make an effective tile cleaner with some basic household items. The cleaner you should use depends on the type of backsplash tile you have:

### Ceramic, Glass and Porcelain Backsplash Tile

A simple water-vinegar mixture is typically enough to clean ceramic, glass and porcelain tiles. All you need to do is to mix equal parts of vinegar and warm water in a spray bottle. Once the liquids are thoroughly mixed, just lightly spray the tile and gently wipe off with a damp cloth.

### Natural Stone Backsplash Tile

For some types of stone tile, such as limestone, onyx and marble, the vinegar in the previous DIY cleaner can be too harsh and cause unwanted damage. Instead, using warm water with a little bit of dishwashing soap is enough to clean the stone. Be sure to use a nonabrasive cloth or soft sponge to avoid causing any type of damage to the stone.

How Do You Remove Grease From a Backsplash?
-------------------------------------------

While a simple mixture of water and vinegar or water and dishwashing soap can handle the day-to-day cleaning of your backsplash, it may not be strong enough to tackle grease spots or stains. One of the best ways to remove these unwanted grease spots from your kitchen backsplash is to use a special baking soda paste.

Mix two tablespoons of baking soda with one tablespoon of water until it forms a thick paste. Spread this paste over the stained area and let it sit for about 10 minutes. Next, use a clean, damp cloth to gently scrub and wash away the paste. If the stain is not completely gone, you can repeat this step one or two more times.

How Do You Clean the Grout?
---------------------------

Now that your backsplash tile is clean, you may notice that the grout between the tiles is still dingy. You can use the baking soda paste (two tablespoons of baking soda and one tablespoon of water) to clean the kitchen grout. Spread the paste over the grout and let it sit for 10 minutes. Next, use a soft-bristle cleaning brush to firmly scrub the grout area.

If you find mold on your tiles due to a water leak or other reason, it’s recommended to contact a professional to safely remove the mold or install new backsplash tile.<br><iframe width="1072" height="603" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/os8TwrDhoGM?feature=oembed" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
