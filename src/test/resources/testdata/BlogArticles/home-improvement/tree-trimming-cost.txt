Having trees on your property can be very beneficial. They provide shade, produce fruit and give your children something to climb. The downside, though, is that they _keep_ growing. And that growth can be difficult to tame. And when you have a lot of trees on your property, you can't always beat back the growth on your own.

If you go with a professional service, tree trimming costs can be high. Going the DIY route can save you money, but it’s not always the safest thing to do. Here’s what you need to know.

Tree Trimming Costs
-------------------

According to data from [LawnStarter](https://www.lawnstarter.com/blog/cost/tree-trimming-price/), the price range for trimming a single tree is $315 to $700 (CAD 400 to CAD 900), with the national average cost to trim a tree being $475 (CAD 600). Trimming a tree is less expensive than pruning it. The difference between the two practices is that trimming is about improving the appearance of a tree, while pruning involves removing dead and unhealthy growth.

With big trees, hiring a professional service is necessary. The tree company may need to use a bucket truck to reach high branches on tall trees or use other heavy equipment. Expect to pay more when such equipment is necessary.

If you're going to trim a smaller tree yourself, safety is essential. Tree branches are heavy, have sharp ends and can drop unexpectedly. There is a lot of potential for serious injury. You should make sure you know what you’re doing if you decide to DIY.

Costs with DIY include the cost of trimmers, saws and other tools, plus safety equipment like safety glasses, work gloves and a hard hat. You can expect to spend as much as $600 (CAD 760) on equipment if you don't have it already.

If you have a shrub that needs work, the cost of shrub trimming is less than that of trees. They're generally cheaper to maintain because of their smaller size and lower height, and getting the job done is easier.

If you need to trim a tree due to power line obstruction, you could call your utility company. They may do the job for free.

Do Tree Services Charge Per Hour?
---------------------------------

Professional tree companies figure the cost of labor into their quotes, but they quote on a per-tree basis once that figure is determined. So, you can expect to be charged per tree rather than per hour.

What's the Price Difference Between Different Types or Heights of Trees?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The main factor determining tree-trimming costs is the tree's size. [LawnStarter](https://www.lawnstarter.com/blog/cost/tree-trimming-price/) reports that a small tree could cost only $80 (CAD 110), and larger trees can cost upwards of $1,250 (CAD 1,600). With larger trees, labor and equipment costs are a major reason for increased prices.

Oak trees, for instance, have thicker, heavier branches, so they require a lot more work and equipment to trim. But the cost of trimming tall trees is mitigated by the fact that they only need to be trimmed every three to five years.

Fruit trees require annual trimming, increasing your actual cost over time. Small trees under 30 feet (9 meters) tall require a lot less equipment to trim, and their lighter branches are easier for tree trimming companies to remove from the area, resulting in much lower costs.

If you have multiple trees that need trimming, you'll pay a similar amount per tree as for trimming a single tree.

Is It Cheaper to Trim a Tree or Cut It Down?
--------------------------------------------

The cost to cut down a tree is in the range of [$150 to $2,000](https://www.lawnstarter.com/blog/cost/tree-trimming-price/) (CAD 190 to CAD 2,550). The average cost is $630 (CAD 800).

Eliminating the remnants of a felled tree through stump grinding will add $150 to $450 (CAD 190 to CAD 570) to your final cost. The cost to remove any additional stumps is only $35 to $63 (CAD 45 to CAD 80) per stump.
