According to the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the product can break if the towel bar is used to provide bodily support, which could result in a fall and injury.

According to the [CPSC](https://cpsc.gov/Recalls/2021/Signature-Hardware-Recalls-Towel-Grab-Bars-Due-to-Fall-and-Injury-Hazards), the towel grab bars have a straight bar designed for hanging towels, as well as a curved bar intended for bodily support; the towel bar can be folded vertically when not in use. The manufacturer has received 13 complaints of the towel bar and grab bar detaching or partially detaching from each other, two of which cases resulted in falls.

Imported from China by Erlanger, Ky.-based Clawfoot Supply LLC under the name Signature Hardware, affected towel grab bars bear the unit number 920115, which can be found printed on the product purchase receipt and email order confirmations. The polished or brushed stainless steel bars were sold online at signaturehardware.com, amazon.com and build.com between May 2012 through October 2020 for around $140.

Owners should stop using the grab bars immediately and contact Signature Hardware for a full refund or a free replacement bar.

According to the company’s website: “Signature Hardware is also offering to reimburse consumers up to $700 (upon submission of valid receipts for materials and/or labor) for the cost of either (a) removing the recalled product and repairing the wall, or (b) removing the recalled product, installing the replacement, and repairing the wall.”
