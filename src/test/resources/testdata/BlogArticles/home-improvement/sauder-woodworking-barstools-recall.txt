The recall, announced April 28, involves stools with item number 424944 that were manufactured between September 2019 and August 2020. To find the item number and the date your stools were manufactured, check the label on the underside of the seat.

According to the [Consumer Product Safety Commission](https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2021/Sauder-Woodworking-Recalls-Counter-Height-Bar-Stools-Due-to-Fall-Hazard), the stools were made in China and sold online at Wayfair.com, ZOLA.com, CYMAX.com and other online retailers between January 2020 and February 2021, at a price between $85 and $95 per set of two. Sauder Woodworking has received three reports of unstable stools, including two reports of falls; no injuries have been reported.

Sauder Woodworking is contacting all known buyers of affected stools directly.
