According to the [Consumer Product Safety Commission](https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2021/Pool-Heaters-Recalled-by-Pentair-Water-Pool-and-Spa-Due-to-Fire-Hazard), a connection in the pool heaters may leak a combustible air-gas mixture, creating a potential fire risk. The recall was announced April 28. No incidents or injuries have been reported.

The recall affects several models of Pentair Water Pool and Spa’s MasterTemp and Sta-Rite Max-E-Therm pool heaters manufactured between Dec. 22, 2020, and Jan. 6, 2021. To find out if yours has been recalled, check the manufacturing date and model number against [this list](https://www.pentair.com/en-us/landing-pages/pool-heater-recall-information.html). This information can be found on the serial number sticker on the heater.
