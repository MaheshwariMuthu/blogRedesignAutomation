  Kalorik has recalled about 3,525 of its Electric Steakhouse Grills due to a shock hazard. The [Consumer Product Safety Commission](https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2021/Kalorik-Recalls-Electric-Steakhouse-Grills-Due-to-Shock-Hazard-Recall-Alert) is warning consumers to stop using these grills immediately.

In the June 3 recall, the CPSC reported that the grills’ knobs are incorrectly electroplated, which poses a risk of electric shock to users after the grill is fully preheated. Kalorik has received five reports of incidents — three in the U.S. and two in Canada — in which users suffered electric shocks.

According to the Miami Gardens, Fla.-based [importer](http://www.kalorik.com/), this recall affects Model KPRO GR 45602. Grills with these date codes and purchase-order numbers are part of this recall:

* **2019:** PO20-0065
* **2026:** PO20-0259
* **2032:** PO20-0305
* **2033:** PO20-0336

You can find the model number, date code and purchase-order number printed on a silver label on the back of the grill.

The Kalorik electric grills were manufactured in China and sold between July 2020 and March 2021 for about $400 apiece. The grills were sold at [several online retailers](https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2021/Kalorik-Recalls-Electric-Steakhouse-Grills-Due-to-Shock-Hazard-Recall-Alert), including kalorik.com, amazon.com, walmart.com, kohls.com, bedbathandbeyond.com, qvc.com, homedepot.com, macys.com, bestbuy.com, acehardware.com and hammacher.com. In addition, 71 units were sold in Canada.

If you purchased a recalled grill, do not use it. Instead, contact the manufacturer for a free repair kit to replace the electroplated control knobs. Call Kalorik toll-free at 844-847-4556 or email [recall@kalorik.com](mailto:recall@kalorik.com). Kalorik is contacting all known purchasers directly.
