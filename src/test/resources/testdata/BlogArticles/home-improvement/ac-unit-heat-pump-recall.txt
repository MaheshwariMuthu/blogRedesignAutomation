The April 28 recall affects about 710 of these units, originally recalled by their manufacturers between 2004 and 2018. They were refurbished by PTAC Crew and PTAC USA and resold from May 2019 through December 2019.

According to [PTAC Crew](https://ptaccrew.com/ptac-recall-information): “Because we sell refurbished PTAC units, these recalls may affect refurbished inventory that you purchased from us.” The Knoxville, Tenn.-based distributor said the original manufacturer recalls affect several brands, including Goodman Amana, Carrier, Trane and General Electric.

The original recalls were announced for various reasons, including fire and burn hazards. According to the CPSC, the original recalls included reports of units overheating, smoking or catching fire, sometimes leading to [property damage](https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2015/ge-recalls-ge-air-conditioning-and-heating-units) and, in one instance, an injury that [required medical attention](https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2018/goodman-company-recalls-packaged-terminal-air-conditioners-and-heat-pumps-due-to-burn).
