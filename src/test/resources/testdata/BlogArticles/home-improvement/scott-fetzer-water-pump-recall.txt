According to the [Consumer Product Safety Commission](https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2021/Scott-Fetzer-Consumer-Brands-Recalls-Multi-Use-Water-Pumps-Due-to-Fire-and-Shock-Hazards), the water pump’s circuit board can malfunction. If water gets into the electrical circuit board, it may short circuit, creating a potential fire or shock risk. [Scott Fetzer Consumer Brands](http://www.waynepumps.com/waterbugglowrecall/) has received 28 reports of the circuit board malfunctioning, including two incidents that resulted in minor burn injuries.

The recall, announced May 5, affects specifically the WAYNE WaterBUG GLOW Multi-Use Water Removal Pump with SKU number 57732-WYN1. They were sold for $130 in The Home Depot stores, and online at HomeDepot.com and Wilmar.com. The pumps were manufactured in the U.S.
