According to the [Consumer Product Safety Commission](https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2021/Flame-King-Recalls-Hog-100-Pound-Propane-Cylinders-Due-to-Fire-Hazard), the recalled propane cylinders have a handle located below the welded seam. The improper placement could cause the unit to leak propane, which poses a fire hazard. The recall was announced March 24.

Cylinders affected by the recall are white and have a handle placed _below_ the weld line near the top of the unit. You can also see if your cylinder has been recalled by checking the serial number on its collar. Serial numbers 000001 through 002800 have been recalled. Gray cylinders with higher serial numbers and handles above the weld are approved for use.

The Pico Rivera, Calif.-based [manufacturer](https://www.flameking.com/hogrecall) said the affected cylinders were sold from January 2020 through September 2020, at a price of about $250 apiece. They were sold online at Amazon, Wayfair, eBay, The Home Depot and Walmart. The units were manufactured in Thailand. According to the CPSC, no incidents or injuries have been reported.

If your propane cylinder falls under this recall, stop using it immediately and request an exchange or refund via Flame Kingâ€™s hotline: 844-464-8265.
