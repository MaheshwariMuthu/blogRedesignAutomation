  Peloton has announced two [separate recalls](https://www.cpsc.gov/Newsroom/News-Releases/2021/CPSC-and-Peloton-Announce-Recall-of-Tread-Plus-Treadmills-After-One-Child-Death-and-70-Incidents-Recall-of-Tread-Treadmills-Due-to-Risk-of-Injury) involving its Tread and Tread+ treadmills. About 125,000 Tread+ Treadmills have been recalled after one child died and several injuries were reported. Peloton is also recalling the Tread Treadmill due to an unrelated injury risk.

Tread+ Treadmills
-----------------

The Tread+ Treadmill (model TR01) has been recalled due to a risk of injury or death. According to the [Consumer Product Safety Commission](https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2021/peloton-recalls-tread-plus-treadmills-after-one-child-died-and-more-than-70-incidents), adult users, children, pets and objects can be pulled under the rear of the treadmill; a 6-year-old child died after being pulled under the treadmill. Peloton has received 72 reports of incidents, including 29 reports of injuries to children; injury types include second- and third-degree abrasions, broken bones and lacerations.

Prior to the May 5 recall, the CPSC [issued a warning](https://www.cpsc.gov/Newsroom/News-Releases/2021/CPSC-Warns-Consumers-Stop-Using-the-Peloton-Tread) to customers to stop using the product. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onXNnlCYJ4Y) demonstrates the hazard posed by the Tread+ Treadmill. (Warning: Video content may be disturbing to some viewers.)

Manufactured in Taiwan, Tread+ Treadmills were sold online at [onepeloton.com](http://www.onepeloton.com/) and in Peloton showrooms between September 2018 and April 2021 for $4,295. The product was launched as the “Peloton Tread” in 2018, but was renamed “Tread+” in September 2020.

Peloton is urging customers to stop using the Tread+ Treadmill immediately. You can contact the New York-based company for a full refund before Nov. 6, 2022. After that date, customers will receive a partial refund. If you don’t want the refund option, Peloton is offering free relocation of the treadmill to a space in your home where children and pets cannot access it. A software update is also in the works, which would automatically lock the Tread+ with a four-digit passcode when not in use.

Tread Treadmills
----------------

Also announced May 5, Tread Treadmills (model TR02) have been recalled due to safety issue unrelated to that of the Tread+ model. According to the [CPSC](https://cpsc.gov/Recalls/2021/Peloton-Recalls-Tread-Treadmills-Due-to-Risk-of-Injury), the touchscreen can detach and fall, posing an injury risk. Peloton has received 18 reports of loose screens and six reports of screens falling off the treadmill. About 1,050 units have been recalled in the U.S., and an additional 5,400 units have been recalled in Canada. No injuries have been reported in the U.S.; minor cuts and bruises have been reported in Canada and the U.K.

Tread Treadmills were made in Taiwan and sold in an invitation-only release at [onepeloton.com](http://www.onepeloton.com/) and at showrooms between November 2020 and March 2021 for $2,495. If you own a recalled Tread Treadmill, stop using it immediately and contact Peloton for a full refund. Peloton is working on a CPSC-approved repair, which is expected to be available to customers in the coming weeks.
