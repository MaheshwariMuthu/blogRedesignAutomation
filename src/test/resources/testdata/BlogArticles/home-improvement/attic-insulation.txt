Improving your attic's insulation is one way to hold in the heat. Here's how much installation costs — whether you do it yourself or hire a contractor.

Attic Insulation Costs
----------------------

There are several factors to consider when planning to insulate your attic. Attic insulation costs are dependent on the type of insulation you use, the ease of removing the existing insulation and any labor costs involved in the project.

According to [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/home-improvement/attic-insulation-cost/)_,_ if you're having the pros do the job, you can expect to pay $1,500 to $3,500 (CAD 1,900 to CAD 4,500), with an average of $2,500 (CAD 3,200). Also, small attics can cost as little as $500 to insulate, while attic insulation costs for larger spaces can be upwards of $4,000 (CAD 5,100).

The average cost to do it yourself is about $1,250 (CAD 1,600) because you save on labor costs.

The overall cost is greatly affected by which type of insulation you use, and you'll have to pay a bit more to have the pros remove your old insulation. However, energy efficiency gained from adding insulation reduces energy bills, making the costs worthwhile.

As with any DIY project, keep safety in mind. Be careful when climbing into attics, watch out for nails in the ceiling and avoid touching electrical equipment. Consider turning off the power in your attic while you're working.

Types of Insulation
-------------------

Material prices are a major factor in your overall attic insulation costs. Some materials will require more labor hours to install. Some also require special equipment, so those jobs are best left to the professionals. [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/home-improvement/attic-insulation-cost/) lists the prices as follows:

### Loose-Fill or Blown-In Insulation

Fiberglass insulation costs 35 cents (CAD 0.45) per square foot, or about $175 (CAD 225) for a 500-square-foot attic.

Cellulose insulation runs about 33 cents (CAD 0.42) per square foot, so about $160 (CAD 200) for 500 square feet.

Rock wool is more expensive — $2.40 per square foot — and costs about $1,200 (CAD 1,530) for 500 square feet.

### Spray Foam

Material costs run about $3 to $5 (CAD 3.80 to CAD 6.40) per square foot. This material takes special equipment to install, so labor costs are higher.

### Batt or Roll Insulation

Batt or roll insulation is an excellent choice for DIY installation. It's easy to install and works well for attics. It will cost $2 to $4 (CAD 2.50 to CAD 5) per square foot to have it installed.

What Other Factors Impact the Price of Attic Insulation?
--------------------------------------------------------

* **R-value**: The R-value measures how well insulation resists heat flow. The [U.S. Department of Energy's](https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/insulation) map of the country's climate regions can give you an idea of what R-value you'll need for your area. Higher R-value insulation is generally more expensive.
* **Climate**: Depending on your typical winter weather patterns, you'll need more or less insulation. In northern states, using more expensive but warmer insulation is best.
* **Size**: A bigger attic will cost more to insulate while a smaller one limits costs.
* **Accessibility**: Labor costs increase if your attic is constricted or difficult for the workers to access. In the case of DIY projects, this isn't a factor.
* **Airflow and venting**: Some airflow is necessary in an attic to prevent moisture buildup. Adding air vents could increase costs.

How Much Does It Cost to Remove Existing Insulation?
----------------------------------------------------

If you're working with a company to remove the existing insulation, it will run you $1 to $2 (CAD 1.25 to CAD 2.50) per square foot_._ If you do it yourself, you can avoid these costs.

Removing insulation can sometimes cause damage to electrical cables and junction boxes, so you may need to hire an electrician to assess the equipment. This will cost about $80 (CAD 100) an hour.<br><iframe title="YouTube video player" width="1072" height="603" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tbq6uZ9Y0nQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
