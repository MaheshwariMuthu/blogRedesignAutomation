According to the Nov. 12 [recall announcement](https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2022/RH-Recalls-Outdoor-Torches-Due-to-Fire-Hazard-Recall-Alert) by the Consumer Product Safety Commission, RH has received seven reports of fuel leaks. No injuries have been reported.

This recall affects several models of the Lambeth torches. To see if yours is included, check the stock-keeping unit, or SKU, and UPC numbers against [this list](https://rh.com/content/page.jsp?id=safety-recalls). The SKU is printed on a green sticker on the bottom of the canister. You can find both the SKU and UPC on the receipt.

The torches were manufactured in China and sold at RH Galleries, RH Outlets and online at [RH.com](http://rh.com) between July 2020 and August 2021 for $50 to $600. About 1,200 units are involved in this recall. An additional 40 units were sold in Canada.

The CPSC is warning consumers to stop using the recalled torches immediately. RH is providing full refunds of the purchase price, or a credit if the purchase price is unknown. To receive the refund, you need to return the torch lid. You’ll receive a prepaid label and packaging to send the torch lid to RH. When the Madera, Calif.-based company receives the lid, they’ll provide a refund or credit.

RH is contacting all known purchasers directly. You can reach out to the company by calling 833-424-1125, emailing [recall@rh.com](mailto:recall@rh.com) or visiting the [website](https://rh.com/content/page.jsp?id=safety-recalls). RH is asking consumers to provide their name, address, phone number, email address and order number when contacting the company.
