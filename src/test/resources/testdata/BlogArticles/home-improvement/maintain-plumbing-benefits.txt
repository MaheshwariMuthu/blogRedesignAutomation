  Emergency plumbing jobs can be quite expensive. [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/home-improvement/plumbing/emergency-plumber-cost/) says plumbers may charge anywhere from $100 to $500 (CAD 135 to CAD 670) per hour for such jobs, and some add fees of hundreds of dollars if you need emergency work at night or during the weekend.

Luckily for homeowners, regular plumbing maintenance can help reduce the chance of expensive emergencies arising. Here are the top benefits of plumbing maintenance.

1\. Better Water Pressure
-------------------------

Plumbing system maintenance can keep all the inner workings of your home's waterways clear and clean.  When everything is working well — from supply pipes to showerheads — your water pressure tends to be higher than it is when things aren't working well.

General plumbing maintenance that supports good water pressure provides a number of benefits for your household, including:

* **Better quality of life.** Relaxing in a shower with the right water pressure offers an experience that is better than taking a shower without good water pressure. It provides massage relief for your muscles and can help you rinse your body and hair better.
* **Time savings.** Better water pressure means you're not waiting around for the tub to fill or for a pot of water to boil the spaghetti in.
* **Cleaner dishes.** More water pressure can make it easier to clean dishes, especially if you're tackling manual dishwashing jobs.  
    

2\. Fewer Leaks
---------------

When it comes to plumbing and maintenance, a major benefit is a reduction in leaks. When you check your systems regularly, you can identify weak points or issues and correct them before water starts seeping through from pipes or fixtures.

Plumbing maintenance also ensures that you find those small leaks before they become big leaks. That can mean a small inconvenience and expenses rather than a big problem, such as mold growing under your floors or structural problems because water has weakened beams or flooring.

3\. Reduce Utility Costs
------------------------

A top plumbing maintenance tip for homeowners is to get their systems checked regularly. This can help you reduce your utility costs by finding and stopping small leaks. Even a small leak can mean you're using many gallons of water you wouldn't otherwise use, resulting in potentially hundreds of dollars in utility costs every year.

4\. Safer, Healthier Water and Home
-----------------------------------

When your plumbing is in good repair, your water is generally safer. For example, if any of your pipes are corroded or damaged, pollutants and chemicals could be making their way into your water without you knowing it. That can present both short-term and long-term health hazards for your family.

If your fixtures or pipes are leaking, even a little bit, it can result in mildew and mold growth. This can occur inside your walls, beneath flooring and in other areas that you can't see and may not know about. Over time, mold and mildew can create a toxic environment in your home that is disastrous for your health. If the problem gets bad enough, you may not be able to correct it and may have to leave your home. However, some plumbing preventative maintenance can keep you from ending up with such results.

5\. Reduced Chance of Emergency Repairs
---------------------------------------

Finally, as previously mentioned, plumbing maintenance substantially reduces your chances of needing emergency repairs. This can save you a lot of money, but it also provides peace of mind. You can live your life, invite friends and family over and know that your plumbing is likely to hold up to whatever you throw at it.

Should You DIY Plumbing Maintenance?
------------------------------------

If you have some basic understanding of plumbing and are fairly handy, you can do some plumbing maintenance yourself. For example, you can check for leaks around your fixtures or install a new faucet in the bathroom. However, it's typically a good idea to call on a professional to handle larger maintenance and repairs.

If you buy new plumbing fixtures, such as a shower, bathtub or water heater, ask about maintenance and warranty plans so you know what's covered. Consider investing in a plan to cover plumbing services, especially if they include seasonal inspections.<br><iframe title="YouTube video player" width="1072" height="603" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w5BqEYypYJQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen title="You know what they say about #FlushableWipes…"></iframe>
