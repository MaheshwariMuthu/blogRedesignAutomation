According to the [Consumer Product Safety Commission](https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2021/Hillsdale-Furniture-Recalls-Jennings-Counter-and-Bar-Stools-Due-to-Fall-Hazard), the stool seat may break off the base, which could cause the seated person to fall. There have been 21 reported incidents of stool seats dislodging or having loose welding; no injuries have been reported.

The recall was announced by the Louisville, Ky.-based [manufacturer](https://hillsdalefurniture.com/Main/Home/ProductRecalls) on March 10. The safety action affects both the counter- and bar-height versions of the Jennings stool. The recalled stools are labeled with date codes between August 2020 and Jan. 6, 2021. You can find the date code on the bottom of the seat.

The Jennings Counter and Bar Stools were manufactured in Vietnam, and have a tan wooden seat, a wooden back and a metal base. They were sold in furniture stores nationwide, including Raymour, Nebraska Furniture and Mathis Bros. Furniture, among others, for around $200 apiece.

Stop using any recalled stools immediately and contact the manufacturer for a free repair kit. You can call Hillsdale Furniture at 800-832-1777. You can also email [recall@hillsdalefurniture.com](mailto:recall@hillsdalefurniture.com) or visit the [Product Recalls](https://hillsdalefurniture.com/Main/Home/ProductRecalls) page on the company’s website.
