According to the [Consumer Product Safety Commission](https://cpsc.gov/Recalls/2021/Pool-and-Patio-Umbrellas-Recalled-Due-to-Injury-Hazard-Recall-Alert), the umbrella arm can break at the elbow, posing an injury risk to those sitting below. Umbrosa has received five reports of umbrellas breaking. No injuries have been reported.

The recall specifically affects Umbrosa Evolution Umbrellas with the Evolution flexible arm. The May 27 alert includes 200 umbrellas that were [previously recalled](https://cpsc.gov/Recalls/2019/Shadescapes-Recalls-Pool-and-Patio-Umbrellas-Due-to-Injury-Hazard-Recall-Alert) in October 2018; the now-recalled arm was provided as a remedy to that recall.

The umbrellas were manufactured in Belgium. They were sold at the ShadeScapes showroom in Hotchkiss, Colo., and through ShadeScapes dealers and other resellers nationwide, for $1,800 to $7,600.

If you own one of these umbrellas, stop using it immediately and reach out to Umbrosa to receive a free replacement arm. You can contact the Belgium-based manufacturer by calling 800-522-0328 or emailing [recall@umbrosa.be](mailto:recall@umbrosa.be). Umbrosa is contacting all known purchasers directly.
