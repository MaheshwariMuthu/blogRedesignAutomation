  About 132,000 freestanding and slide-in ranges have been recalled by GE Appliances due to a tip-over hazard. If the anti-tip-over bracket is not secured, the ranges can tip when a heavy object is placed on the oven door. This poses a risk of burn injuries from hot food that may spill during such an incident. No injuries or incidents have been reported.

According to the Dec. 8 [recall alert](https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2022/GE-Appliances-a-Haier-Company-Recalls-to-Repair-Free-Standing-and-Slide-In-Ranges-Due-to-Tip-Over-Hazard) published by the Consumer Product Safety Commission, this recall affects the 20-, 24- and 30-inch freestanding and slide-in electric and gas ranges with brand names GE, GE Profile, Café, Haier, Hotpoint, Crosley and Conservator. A list of affected model and serial numbers can be found [here](https://www.geappliances.com/ge/recall/freestanding-slidein-ranges-2021/).

The ranges were manufactured in Mexico and sold by various home improvement and appliance retailers — such as [Lowe’s](https://www.lowes.com), [The Home Depot](https://www.homedepot.com) and [Best Buy](https://www.bestbuy.com) — in stores and online between May 2021 and July 2021 for $580 to $4,600. In addition, about 12,960 units were sold in Canada.

If you believe your range is included in the recall, check the model and serial numbers using the checker on the [GE Appliances website](https://www.geappliances.com/ge/recall/freestanding-slidein-ranges-2021/). Follow the instructions on the page to locate the model number on your appliance.

If your range does fall under this recall, contact GE Appliances to schedule a free in-home service call. The technician will inspect the anti-tip bracket to ensure it’s properly installed. The Louisville, Ky.–based manufacturer said it’s OK to continue using your cooker while you wait for an inspection — as long as you don’t rest objects on the open door.

Do not return a recalled range to the store where you purchased it; according to the CPSC, the retailers aren’t prepared to take the units back.

GE Appliances is contacting all known purchasers directly. You can reach out to the company by calling the recall hotline at 1-877-247-9770. Before you call, make sure you have your serial and model numbers handy.
