You’ve got a closet full of clothes — and yet — you can never seem to find anything to wear. The problem may come down to a lack of organization.

Whether you’re a neat freak who’s obsessed with organization or you just want a more efficient way to use your closet space, a closet organization system can help you get the most out of what you may consider a small, insignificant room in your home.

What Are the Benefits of a Personal Closet Organization System?
---------------------------------------------------------------

Creating your own closet organization isn't only about making things look neat and clean. There are practical purposes for designing an organizational system that works for your family. Consider some of these benefits.

### It Saves Money

The average family of four spends about $1,800 (CAD 2,400) per year on new clothes, according to the [U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/cesan.pdf). This is despite the fact that many of your new outfits may get lost in your closet and never see the light of day again. Organizing your closet space may help you use the clothing you have and cut back on new clothes spending.

### It Helps the Environment

The fashion industry is responsible for about 10% of global greenhouse emissions, according to the [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200310-sustainable-fashion-how-to-buy-clothes-good-for-the-climate). The materials used to manufacture clothing may require oil or large amounts of water. For example, one pair of jeans can require up to 10,000 liters of water to produce.

If you’re alarmed by this, you can reduce your footprint by holding onto your clothes for longer and resisting the urge to add to your wardrobe. A closet organization system may help you do that.

### It Saves You Time

When you create a system that makes it easy to browse and locate clothing, accessories and jewelry, you may get out the door sooner in the morning. If you find that you’re constantly rushing out the door or often need to run through the house in search of a missing sock, shoe or glove, organizing your closet may be a good idea.

DIY Closet Organization Tips
----------------------------

If you’re looking to organize your closet and don’t know where to begin, consider the following ideas to spark your imagination.

### 1\. Get a Shoe Rack

Shoes can easily claim all of your floor space and turn into an organizational nightmare, especially if you have a lot of them. One solution is to purchase space-saving shoe racks. Place them on the wall wherever they fit into your other design plans, and never search for a lost shoe again.

### 2\. Install Pull-Out Drawers

Create your own drawer system in the closet. One major benefit of putting a drawer system in your closet is that you might not need dressers in your bedroom, freeing up space for something else.

### 3\. Use Floor Space for Cubbies

If you’ve cleared your shoes off the floor, you now have ample space between the floor and the garment rack to create an organizational system. You could use this storage space for bins and baskets that are marked by what they’re meant to hold.

### 4\. Consider a Closet Organization System

Many retailers sell ready-to-go closet organization systems that you can install within your closet, whether you have a small closet or a walk-in. Everything you need to organize your things is included, from shelf dividers to clothing racks and shoe racks.

### 5\. Use Wall Space to Install Dressers

You can use your closet as a custom dresser by installing shelves, shelf dividers and drawers as you see fit. This allows you to set your closet up in any configuration you’d like and offers more customization than buying a predesigned closet system.

### 6\. Create a Hanger for Hats and Gloves

If you’ve ever spent hours searching for a rogue glove or have a habit of losing your hats, you can create a hanger for these items on the back of your closet door. All you need are some dowels that you can pick up at the local hardware store, along with curtain rings and wire hooks that can grip hats or gloves. You can also use this idea to organize jewelry and other accessories.

### 7\. Get Creative With Shower Hooks

If you have a small closet and a lot of things to hang inside, you can use shower curtain hooks for hanging things. A shower hook can easily slip into belt loops, sleeves, hats and jewelry. If you load a hanger up with shower hooks, you can give it the utility of 10 to 20 hangers at little cost.<br><iframe title="YouTube video player" width="1072" height="603" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-w93u9ICMks?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen title="Who the Heck Is HomeServe???"></iframe>
