Thankfully, error codes can help you diagnose the issue. With the help of this code, you can get your Whirlpool dryer working again so you still look polished on Monday morning.

What Is an Error Code?
----------------------

In software and electronics, error codes let someone know what’s gone wrong with a machine. This stops service technicians from having to take apart the whole dryer to find the cause of every issue and makes repairs easier and less expensive. Error codes also allow you to fix problems by yourself so you don’t have to take a day off to wait for a repairman. Your Whirlpool dryer user manual should include a troubleshooting guide that lists error codes and tells you how to fix the problem and when you need to call for help.

What Are the Common Whirlpool Dryer Error Codes, and What Do They Mean?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Whirlpool has a variety of dryers and each uses different error codes, so it’s important to check your user manual to ensure you have the correct information. Most are made up of a combination of letters and numbers, but some are indicator lights. There are also symbols used as error codes.

Whirlpool has troubleshooting guides on [its website](https://producthelp.whirlpool.com/) for different dryer models. You can search these guides to find options for fixing these and other errors.

Below are some of the common error codes in front-loading, compact heat pump and top-loading dryers.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Often there’s no need to call a repair tech. It’s possible that you only need to clean out the lint screen or close the door properly to get your dryer working properly. However, there are other errors that do need expert assistance.

The Whirlpool website has detailed steps on how you can attempt to fix a variety of errors. It also says when you need to call a repair tech.
