  Few things activate the dopamine in our brains better than the comforting aroma of freshly dried clothes. So, when something goes wrong with your dryer, it’s more than an inconvenience.

Most Frequently Repaired Dryer Parts
------------------------------------

In comparison with other large appliances in your home, the dryer’s mechanism is relatively simple. Therefore, fewer things can go wrong. However, when something does, it can be as frustrating as when any other appliance fails. Let’s look at the top three likely dryer repair parts.

### 1\. The Door Switch

The door switch is an unassuming part of the appliance, yet it’s vital to a successful drying cycle. A door that doesn't close fully means a dryer that won’t start. In an electric dryer, the switch completes the circuit, allowing the heating element to engage and start the drying process. In a gas dryer, it’s a safety mechanism that prevents the release of gas, ensuring the burner can only ignite when the door is closed. Consequently, when the door switch fails, your dryer won't work.

The most common causes of door switch faults are:

*   A faulty connection
*   Continuous opening and closing of the dryer door, causing the contact within the switch to wear down
*   Misalignment of the switch or latch

#### Price to Repair or Replace

Where you live will factor into how much you’re likely to pay for repairs. However, generally speaking, [HomeGuide](https://homeguide.com/costs/dryer-repair-cost#:~:text=%24100%20%E2%80%93%20%24300-,Door%20/%20switch,-%2480%20%E2%80%93%20%24200) says you should expect to pay in the region of $80 to $200 (CAD 109 to CAD 272).

#### Maintenance Tips

Gently close and open the door every time. Like any part, using it roughly means it’s more likely to break at some point.

### 2\. Blown Thermal Fuse

The thermal fuse is situated in the heating element circuit. Its purpose is to interrupt the power supply if the dryer's temperature becomes excessively high. A blown thermal fuse disrupts the heat source, leaving your dryer unable to generate warmth. The result is prolonged drying times, ineffective cleaning and damp laundry. It’s also a potential safety risk, so you shouldn’t use the dryer if this fault occurs.

The most common causes of thermal fuse faults are:

*   Inadequate ventilation, which allows hot air to accumulate inside, triggering the fuse’s safety mechanism to prevent a potential fire
*   A faulty cycling thermostat failing to regulate the dryer’s temperature, resulting in overheating and triggering the fuse’s safety feature
*   A blockage in the dryer’s airflow path, such as lint in the exhaust vent or duct, generating excessive heat and blowing the fuse

#### Price to Repair or Replace

You should expect to pay between [$75 and $150](https://homeguide.com/costs/dryer-repair-cost#:~:text=$100%20%E2%80%93%20$250-,Thermal%20fuse,-$75%20%E2%80%93%20$150) (CAD 102 and CAD 204) to replace a thermal fuse. Replacing fuses in electric dryers is typically less costly than in gas alternatives, due to their simpler design and fewer safety concerns regarding gas-related components.

#### Maintenance Tips

Regularly check your dryer’s vent and exhaust ducts to ensure they’re free of lint and other debris. Get into the habit of routinely removing blockages.

### 3\. Gas Valve Coils

Gas valve coils regulate the release of gas needed for heating. When the dryer initiates a drying cycle, the gas coils receive an electrical signal, opening them to permit the flow of gas to the burner. Conversely, when the cycle concludes, the coils close, cutting off the gas supply. If they fail, the flow of gas to the burner is either erratic or nonexistent. The result is no heat or not enough to dry the clothes. Addressing faulty gas coils promptly is essential for restoring the dryer's functionality and preventing potential safety hazards.

The most common causes of gas valve faults are:

*   The electromagnetic coils degrading over time, causing them to fail to open and close properly
*   Exposure to contaminants, such as dust, lint and other debris, interfering with operation
*   Wear and tear resulting from opening and closing during repeated drying cycles

#### Price to Repair or Replace

As with all dryer repair parts, the cost for gas valve coils varies depending on the brand and model of the dryer. Therefore, you should budget between [$100 and $200](https://homeguide.com/costs/dryer-repair-cost#:~:text=$80%20%E2%80%93%20$200-,Coil,-$100%20%E2%80%93%20$200) (CAD 136 to CAD 272), but this figure could be higher due to the safety measures required when dealing with gas-related appliances.

#### Maintenance Tips

Periodically check for dust, lint or debris accumulation around the gas valve coil area. Gently clean the components with a soft brush or compressed air to remove potential contaminants. Also, as with any type of dryer, you’ll get more years of uninterrupted service from your appliance if you have a contract for scheduled maintenance with a reputable dryer technician.<br><iframe title="YouTube video player" width="1072" height="603" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A9xjT6ikKx0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen title="Your ~literal~ step by step guide on how to remove lint from your dryer vents."></iframe>
