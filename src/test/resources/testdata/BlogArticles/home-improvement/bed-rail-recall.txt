The bed rails are designed to support adult users getting into and out of bed. They are secured to beds with retention straps. When the rail is improperly attached to a bed, the user can become trapped within the rail or between the rail and the side of the mattress, which poses an entrapment hazard and a risk of death by asphyxiation.

According to the Dec. 6 [recall announcement](https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2022/Drive-DeVilbiss-Healthcare-Recalls-Adult-Portable-Bed-Rails-After-Two-Deaths-Entrapment-and-Asphyxiation-Hazards) by the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the two reported deaths occurred in 2011 and 2015 after the users were trapped between the bed rail and their mattress. In both cases, the retention straps were not secured.

About 496,100 units are involved in this recall. They were sold from October 2007 through December 2021 at medical supply stores and by online retailers [Walmart](http://walmart.com) and [Amazon](http://amazon.com) for $30 to $80. Additionally, about 68,000 units were [sold in Canada](https://recalls-rappels.canada.ca/en/alert-recall/home-bed-assist-handles-recalled-due-potential-entrapment-hazard), and 119 were sold in Mexico.
