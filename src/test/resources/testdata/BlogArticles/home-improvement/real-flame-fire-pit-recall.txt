According to the July 15 recall, the Racine, Wis.-based [manufacturer](http://www.realflame.com) has received one report of a fire that resulted in minor property damage. No injuries have been reported.

This recall affects both the Arroyo and Hideaway Wood Burning Fire Pits. The Arroyo model is a chiminea-style fireplace and has the UPC 752370060107, while the Hideaway model is round and has the UPC 752370064501.
