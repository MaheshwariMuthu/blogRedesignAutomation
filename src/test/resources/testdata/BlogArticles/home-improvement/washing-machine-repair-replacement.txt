If your home appliance has been in use for several years, you may be unsure whether to repair or replace it when it malfunctions. Consider the points below:

### Repair

A relatively new washer may not break down regularly, hence it may be more affordable to repair it.

Plus, it may be pricey to have a high-quality technician perform the repairs. Again, you should replace the washing machine if the total cost to repair exceeds 50% of the cost of a new unit.

It's advisable to check your warranty when you want to repair or replace a washing machine. Your costs may come down significantly if the appliance is still new and under warranty. However, if it’s out of warranty, you may have to foot the entire cost, however you choose to proceed.

## 3. The Problem

After discovering that your washer and dryer are malfunctioning, you can consult an expert from an appliance repair company to assist you in pinpointing the problem. Fixing some problems with your appliance may be cheap and require no special skills. Others may be costly to fix and require a professional, however.

Some parts, such as pulleys, pumps and seals, are inexpensive. You can get these replacement parts from your nearest store and install them yourself. However, remember to first contact an expert to assist you in identifying the specific issue.

### Replace 

If a reputable technician tells you your washing machine has serious issues, like a cracked tub, a replacement could be the only viable alternative. Replacing an laundry machine that’s no longer spinning is also cheaper than fixing it.

## 4. Efficiency 

The performance of your washing machine may also determine whether you need to get a new one. If you're using an older model, your water, energy and detergent consumption may be higher than with a newer model. A washing machine with an [Energy Star rating](https://www.energystar.gov/products/appliances/clothes_washers) will use as much as 33% less water than a non-rated model.

Advanced home appliances tend to be more expensive than standard ones. For instance, front-loaded washing machines are generally costlier than top-loading ones. Although the former is more efficient than the latter, it's important to consider your specific needs. If you have a lot of things to wash, a more expensive but energy-efficient machine might be preferable because you may offset the price difference over time. You may also benefit from tax credits and rebates when you choose efficient appliances.

## 5. The Impact of Maintenance on Lifespan

[Cleaning your washing machine](/en-us/blog/how-to/clean-washing-machine/) often can improve its performance and extend its lifespan. Using your home appliance as recommended by the manufacturer will help keep it operational for an extended period without the need for repair or replacement.

If you don't clean and lubricate the valves often, the attached particles may restrict their movement.

These cleaning and maintenance tips can prevent parts of the machine from overworking even when handling a small load.

## 6. Budget

Sometimes, the high cost of a new laundry machine may make fixing the old one the only viable option. The price of a new washing machines ranges between [$300 and $1,500](https://www.energystar.gov/products/appliances/clothes_washers). Although newfangled models may be more effective and energy-efficient than older models, their high purchase price may force you to turn to an expert for repair as long as the quote for service is low enough.
