[Usines Giant Factories](https://giantinc.com/wp-content/uploads/docs/GI-Recall002En-0921-F.pdf) is recalling gas water heaters with Emerson-made control valves because the valves have a non-conformant screw and bracket, which can prevent them from closing properly. This can cause soot to accumulate on the burner, posing a risk of carbon monoxide poisoning to users. If you have one of these units, here’s what you need to know.

According to the Consumer Product Safety Commission’s Nov. 3 [recall announcement](https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2022/Usines-Giant-Factories-Recalls-Gas-Water-Heaters-with-Emerson-Control-Valves-Due-to-Risk-of-Carbon-Monoxide-Poisoning), no incidents or injuries have been reported in the U.S. Twenty incidents involving the Emerson control valves have been reported in Canada, including one in which carbon monoxide was released, resulting in the need for medical attention.

The recall involves specifically propane and natural gas water heaters with 40-, 50- and 75-gallon capacities. To see if your unit is one of them, check the model number on the nameplate near the gas control valve. Affected model numbers include:

*   UG40-38LFPV2-P1U-US
*   UG40-40LFPV2-N1U-US
*   UG50-38LFPV2-P1U-US
*   UG50-38LFPV2-P2U-US
*   UG50-38TFPDV1-N2U-US
*   UG50-40LFPV2-N1U-US
*   UG50-40LFPV2-N2U-US
*   UG75-76MEPV1-N2U-US
*   UG75-76MEPV1-P2U-US

The control valves are black and have a white “Emerson” logo on the front. The model number and date code are printed on a label next to the bracket that holds the control valve to the water heater. Recalled model numbers are 37H73A-301P1 for natural gas models and 37H74A-301P1 for propane models. Affected date codes fall between 1821 and 1839.

The control valves were manufactured in Mexico, and the water heaters were manufactured in Canada. Of the recalled units, 168 water heaters were sold in the U.S. and 10,832 were sold in Canada. They were sold by various plumbing supply companies (find the list [here](https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2022/Usines-Giant-Factories-Recalls-Gas-Water-Heaters-with-Emerson-Control-Valves-Due-to-Risk-of-Carbon-Monoxide-Poisoning)) between June 2018 and July 2020 for $840 to $2,100.

Owners of these units should reach out to Usines Giant Factories immediately to arrange a free replacement of the control valve by a certified technician. If you need to continue using the water heater while you’re waiting for a repair, the CPSC recommends placing working carbon monoxide detectors outside sleeping areas and on every level of your home.
