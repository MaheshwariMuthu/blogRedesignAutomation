  About 29,500 B-Air VP-33 blower fans have been recalled due to a fire risk. Importer Intertex has received five reports of the fans’ capacitors overheating, causing fire-related property damage totaling about $75,000. No injuries have been reported.

According to the Aug. 18 [recall alert](https://cpsc.gov/Recalls/2021/Intertex-Recalls-Blower-Fans-Due-to-Fire-Hazard) from the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the recalled blower fans were manufactured in China, then sold at The Home Depot and Menard’s stores, and online at HomeDepot.com and Amazon.com between February 2013 and December 2017 for about $200.

Only B-Air-branded VP-33 blower fans are involved in this recall. The West Chester, Pa.-based [manufacturer](https://b-air.com/vp33recall/) said the affected models were manufactured before Jan. 1, 2018, and have an Electrical Testing Labs (ETL) number on the label starting with “317.” Units manufactured after that date are not impacted by the recall.

If you purchased a recalled blower fan, do not use it. Instead, contact Intertex for a free repair kit that includes an S-3 capacitor and installation instructions. Call the company at 800-465-7300, email [VP33recall@b-air.com](mailto:VP33recall@b-air.com) or visit [B-Air's website](https://b-air.com/vp33recall/) for additional information.
