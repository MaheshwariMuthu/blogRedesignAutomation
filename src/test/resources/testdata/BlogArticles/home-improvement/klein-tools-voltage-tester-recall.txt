Affected devices include Klein Tools Non-Contact Voltage Testers bearing model number NCVT-1 and date codes ending in H7, as well as units sold separately as part of a kit for roughly $17 to $68, between January 2020 and March 2021 at The Home Depot stores, industrial distributors, electrical wholesalers and some hardware stores nationwide. The meters, manufactured in China and rated CAT IV and measure electricity up to 1,000 volts, have a yellow body housing with a tinted gray tip and a black pocket clip/battery cap on the back. Owners can find the model number on top of each unit, above the brand name, Klein Tools, whereas the date codes are printed on the bottom of the unit, _under_ the brand name; compare the model number to the [recall list, here](https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2021/Non-Contact-Voltage-Testers-Recalled-by-Klein-Tools-Due-to-Shock-Hazard).

The Lincolnshire, Ill.-based distributor of the devices, Klein Tools, said it has received two reports of incidents involving malfunctioning voltage testers, including one shock injury. In addition to the 1.69 million sold in the United States, an additional 67,800 were sold in Canada. The company urges owners to stop using the devices immediately and contact Klein Tools for a free replacement.
