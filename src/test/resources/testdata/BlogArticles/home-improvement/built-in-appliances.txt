Should you go with built-in appliance options or freestanding units? Looking at the pros and cons can help you decide.

What Appliances Can Be Built In?
--------------------------------

Most kitchen appliances can be built in. A built-in appliance, also called an integrated appliance, is one that's integrated seamlessly into the cabinets, sitting flush with the cabinets and often featuring a front panel that matches your cabinetry. Some examples of appliances that can be built in include:

*   Refrigerators and freezers
*   Dishwashers
*   Ovens
*   Microwaves
*   Cooktops
*   Wine coolers
*   Warming drawers

Pros of Built-In Appliances
---------------------------

Aesthetics are often a prime reason people explore the built-in appliance route, but there are other benefits.

* **Seamless, uniform appearance:** Freestanding appliances are easy to spot. The main appeal of a built-in appliance is the way it disappears into the cabinetry, especially when you choose a front panel that matches your cupboards. These appliances sit flush with the cabinets, so they don't stand out as much as freestanding models.
* **Space-effective:** Built-in models are designed to fit into a specific space. They come in a variety of sizes, making it easier to fit them into your available space. The flush installation eliminates hangover that can take up extra floor space in small kitchens.
* **Versatile:** You can find models that fit any size and style of kitchen, from a built-in fridge for a modern kitchen to a built-in dishwasher that's perfect for a farmhouse theme.
* **Increased value:** The upscale appearance can boost the value of your home, which is an important consideration when you're upgrading your kitchen.

Cons of Built-in Appliances
---------------------------

Before you move forward with your built-in fridge or built-in dishwasher, it's important to look at the cons. Consider these potential issues to make sure the pros outweigh them.

* **No room for movement:** Because these appliances are integrated into your cabinetry, they can't be moved to another location. They might not be the best fit if you think you might want to rearrange your kitchen in the future.
* **Cost:** You can typically expect to spend more for a built-in appliance compared to a similar freestanding model. This can take up a large portion of your kitchen budget.
* **Difficult to repair:** Because these appliances are built in, they're a little more challenging to repair. You might pay more on repair bills than you would for a standalone appliance with the same issue.
* **Professional installation:** Built-in appliances generally need to be installed by professionals, which adds to the overall cost.
* **Inability to take the appliances:** Because they're designed to fit the kitchen and built into the structure, these appliances usually have to stay with the house.
* **Shallow design:** Built-in appliances often aren't as deep as freestanding models because they sit flush with the cabinets. This can leave less space inside. However, they're also usually taller, which can make up for some of the lost space.

Pros and Cons of Freestanding or Slide-In Models
------------------------------------------------

Freestanding and slide-in kitchen appliances are very popular. Looking at the pros and cons of these types can help you compare them to built-in appliances. Pros of freestanding or slide-in appliances include:

* **Affordability:** You can find lower-priced options in freestanding and slide-in models, which can help you stick to your remodeling budget.
* **Flexibility:** Freestanding appliances are easy to move around if you decide to rearrange your kitchen. Being able to pull them out can also make repairs easier if something happens to your appliance.
* **Deeper drawers and shelves:** These models are usually deeper, which can give you more space and hold larger items.

Some cons to consider include:

* **Larger footprint:** Many freestanding and slide-in models are larger and come in fewer size options. They can take up precious space in a smaller kitchen. 
* **Bulkier appearance:** These models are often bulky and quite noticeable in your kitchen. 
* **Lack of customization:** While you can find a variety of styles and finishes, you don't have the customization options that you get with built-in appliances. 

Freestanding, slide-in and built-in appliances can all work well in most kitchens. Deciding comes down to your budget and your overall preferences.<br><iframe title="YouTube video player" width="1072" height="603" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ByKX1s5TgBY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen title="How to Clean Your Oven | Cleaning Oven Tips and Tricks"></iframe>
