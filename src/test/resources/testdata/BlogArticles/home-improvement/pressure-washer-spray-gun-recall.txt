According to the [Consumer Product Safety Commission](https://cpsc.gov/Recalls/2021/One-Million-Greenworks-and-Powerworks-Pressure-Washer-Spray-Guns-Recalled-Due-to-Impact-Injury-Hazard-Distributed-by-Hongkong-Sun-Rise-Trading), the hose or other parts of a broken spray gun connector can become loose under pressure. The manufacturer, Hongkong Sun Rise of China, has received 15 reports of incidents, 13 of which resulted in injuries; seven individuals required medical attention for post-concussion syndrome, broken bones or injuries to the mouth and eyes.

The recall, announced April 7, specifically impacts the Greenworks 2,000 psi plastic spray gun; psi is a measure of pressure by pounds per square inch. This spray gun was included with Powerworks Pressure Washers with 1,700 to 1,800 psi, as well as Greenworks Pressure Washers ranging from 1,500 to 1,800 psi. It was also sold in an accessory kit.

The full list of affected model numbers is listed on [Greenworks’ website](https://www.greenworkstools.com/important-safety-notices). The model number can be found on the back of the pressure washer, near the top of the unit. Additionally, the CPSC notes that recalled models have black plastic — not metal — hose connectors. Take the spray gun off the hose and check the interior connector.

Greenworks and Powerworks pressure washers were sold between January 2017 and February 2021 at Lowe’s stores, Lowes.com, Amazon.com and other websites. The pressure washers were priced between $100 and $180, and the accessory kit for about $40.

Stop using any recalled spray guns immediately and contact the manufacturer for a free spray gun handle replacement.
