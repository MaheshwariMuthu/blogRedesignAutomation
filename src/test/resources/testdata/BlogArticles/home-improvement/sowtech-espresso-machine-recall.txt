In the July 8 [recall announcement](https://cpsc.gov/Recalls/2021/LoHi-Tech-Recalls-SOWTECH-Espresso-Machines-Due-to-Burn-Hazard-Recall-Alert), the Consumer Product Safety Commission reported that the espresso machine’s glass carafe could break while in use, exposing the user to hot liquid. LoHi Tech has received 48 reports of broken carafes, which resulted in five burn injuries.

According to the Walnut, Calif.-based distributor, this recall affects SOWTECH espresso machines with model number CM6811 printed on a silver label on the bottom of the unit. Only units with glass carafes are affected by this recall.

The espresso machines roasters were manufactured in China and sold online at [Amazon.com](http://amazon.com/) and [LoHi-Direct.com](https://lohi-direct.com/) between March 2017 and October 2020 for about $60.

If you purchased a recalled espresso machine, you should stop using it immediately. Contact the manufacturer to receive a free replacement metal carafe. Call the company toll-free at 888-613-3170, email [lohitech@outlook.com](mailto:lohitech@outlook.com) or register online [here](http://www.amz-lohitech.com/).
