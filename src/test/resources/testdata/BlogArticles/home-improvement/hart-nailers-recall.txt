According to the Nov. 12 [recall alert](https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2022/Hart-Consumer-Products-Recalls-Nailers-Due-to-Injury-Hazard-Sold-Exclusively-at-Walmart), the Anderson, S.C.-based company has is aware of no reported incidents or injuries related to the defect.

The recall specifically involves Hart 18-Gauge 2” Brad Nailers bearing model numbers HPNR01, HPNR01B, HPNR01B-SK and HPNR01BNCA; the model number is printed on the side of the nail tray or magazine into which the nails are loaded. The handheld nail guns are identifiable by their white, blue and black coloring, the brand name printed on the side in white against a black background, and the model name — “18ga BRAD NAILER” — printed in white type against a blue background on the side of the nail tray/magazine.

The nail guns were manufactured in Vietnam by Techtronic Industries Vietnam Manufacturing Co. and imported to the U.S. by Hart Consumer Products. The devices were sold between April and September 2021 at Walmart stores nationwide as well as online via [walmart.com](https://www.walmart.com), for between $130 and $160.

If you own one of the recalled nail guns, you should stop using it and return it for a full refund to any Walmart store in the U.S., or schedule a free mail pickup from your home by calling 800-776-5191.
