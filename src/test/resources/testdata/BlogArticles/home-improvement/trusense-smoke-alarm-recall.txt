Affected devices include Kidde Model Series 2040, 2050, 2060 and 2070 Smoke and Combination Smoke/Carbon Monoxide alarms — all of which have either a TruSense brand logo or “AMBER=FAULT” printed on the front. The devices’ respective model numbers are printed on the back. The alarms were manufactured in China and sold in the U.S. between May 2019 and September 2020 for $10 to $70 at Walmart, The Home Depot, Menards and other retail stores nationwide, as well as online at Amazon.com, ShopKidde.com and elsewhere.

Households should contact Kidde immediately for a free replacement alarm. The CPSC advised owners to continue using the recalled alarms until the replacement devices are installed.
