  Thanksgiving and all its casseroles, meats and treats are notoriously hard on the pipes inside your _body._ But the holiday can also wreak havoc on the pipes inside your _home_ — so much so that plumbers have a name for the abnormally high-call day after Thanksgiving: [Brown Friday](https://www.realtor.com/advice/home-improvement/beware-of-brown-friday-plumbers-busiest-day-of-the-year/). (_Ew_!)

Broken garbage disposals, backed-up showers and monster clogs in the kitchen sink are nothing to be thankful for. Keep these three tips in mind this holiday to prevent plumbing problems.

1\. Skip the Garbage Disposal
-----------------------------

Even in the best of times, your garbage disposal can get bound up by fibrous foods, such as celery, rhubarb, potato skins and onion peels. On Thanksgiving, the threat is only compounded by starchy leftovers like stuffing, rice, baked beans and mac ’n’ cheese. These expand when they get wet, creating a carby clog in your drain. In trying to dispose of a plentiful bounty of waste, you run the risk of overburdening your machine. This can lead to burnout (a concept many of us who are thankful for these few days off are all too familiar with) and a call to your plumber.

Your best bet is to treat your sink as if you don’t have a garbage disposal at all. In fact, don’t even tell your kind, dish-washing guests that you have one, lest they get any ideas. Instead, put a strainer in the drain to catch particles and empty scraps and leftovers straight into the trash can.

2\. Remember: Oil and Water Don’t Mix
-------------------------------------

If you get nothing else from this, just please take away this essential piece of advice: Grease has no place in your drains.

Anything greasy — like frying oil, fat, meat drippings and melted butter — is only a true liquid while it’s hot. And during that state of matter, you might believe that it’s perfectly fine to pour it right down the drain. But, at some point, you’re going to run some cold water in the sink. This could cause that grease, which hasn’t made it all the way out of your plumbing system, to harden. Over time, it can clump together, creating an impenetrable ball of fat only a plumber can remove.

Wait for grease to cool before pouring it into an empty can or other disposable container. Then, dispose of it in the trash. If you’re worried about tossing too much liquid, you can freeze it first. If you have a large volume of frying oil, consider purchasing a grease disposal system or disposable grease bags.

3\. Keep Tabs on Your Guests’ Bathroom Habits
---------------------------------------------

No matter if you have overnight guests for the better part of the week or some drifters blowing in and out for dinner and dessert, they’re going to need to use your bathroom. And at the risk of sounding like you’re trying to micromanage your guests’ hygiene routine, you’re going to want to set some ground rules.

Here’s what we suggest:

*   Wait at least [ten minutes](https://www.rotorooter.com/blog/drains/thanksgiving-plumbing-tips-from-nations-top-plumbing-and-drain-specialists/) between showers. This will give your drains time to clear and your water heater time to catch back up.
*   The toilet is for toilet paper and human waste only. Everything else (cotton swabs, food, wrappers, face wipes, diapers, etc.) should find its way to the bathroom trashcan.
*   Flushable wipes are — get this — _not_ flushable. Despite the branding, they just don’t break down like toilet paper does. So, the TP-only rule stands.
*   Let ’er drip! If you have certain faucets you keep dripping to avoid pipe freezing, let your guests know this is not a water-wasting oversight on your part.

Whether you type these up in an aggressive font and post the list opposite the toilet or just kindly ask your guests to respect your pipes is up to you — just make sure they know what's up.

An Ounce of Prevention…
-----------------------

Of course, good plumbing maintenance year-round can lessen the shock to the system that is a houseful of guests and a kitchen full of food. But these tips should help you get through Brown Friday as uneventfully as possible.

And listen: Your local plumber (who’d like to enjoy their holiday, too, mind you) is practically _begging_ you to heed this advice. And if you don’t? Well … At least they’ll get to collect sky-high [emergency plumbing callout fees](https://www.forbes.com/home-improvement/plumbing/emergency-plumber-cost/) for services rendered on a holiday or the weekend.
