  You just finished shoveling a foot of snow, and you’re looking forward to a long, hot shower. Unfortunately, you have low water pressure, so the shower isn't as relaxing as you’d expected. If you have low water pressure, you know what a pain it is to fill the tub, blast stuck-on food off your favorite dishes or unwind in the shower at the end of a long day.

The good news is that it's possible to install a water pressure booster pump. You don't absolutely need one, but it's a good investment if you're frustrated by low water pressure in your kitchen and bathroom.

What Is a Water Pressure Booster Pump?
--------------------------------------

A water pressure booster pump is just what it sounds like — a pump that helps you combat low water pressure. Once you install the pump, it acts as a go-between, pressurizing water before it reaches your sinks, showers and tubs. Extra pressure increases your water's flow rate, making it easier to fill up the bathtub or get ready to soak a load of dishes in the kitchen sink. You can even use a water pressure booster pump to make your sprinkler work more efficiently.

The standard pump delivers water at a constant rate, while a variable-speed drive pump allows you to adjust the flow rate based on your needs. For example, if you have a sprinkler that requires high water pressure, you can use a VSD to increase the flow rate as needed.

What Are Some Signs That You Need a Water Pressure Booster Pump in Your Home?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you frequently experience fluctuations in water pressure, you may need to install a water pressure booster to distribute water more efficiently. For example, if your kitchen sink flows like Old Faithful one minute and barely produces a trickle the next, you should consider installing a booster pump to keep things consistent. A complete lack of water flow is also a sign that you may need a water booster pump.

Do You Absolutely Need to Install a Water Pressure Booster?
-----------------------------------------------------------

Honestly, it depends on a few factors. Before you install a water pressure booster, have a plumber come to your home and diagnose the cause of your low water pressure. If you have a plumbing problem, installing a water pressure booster pump may make things worse instead of better. A few things can cause low water pressure in a home:

### Leaks

When your plumbing system is working normally, water flows in from the source, travels through the pipes and comes out of your faucets, taps and showerheads. If you have a leak, the water drains elsewhere, so it never reaches the endpoints of the system. It's important to address leaks before you install a booster pump, or else you could make the damage worse.

### Installation Problems

Before you invest in a booster pump, check each tap, faucet and shower head to determine if the problem is widespread or limited to just one fixture. If the water pressure is only low in one fixture, it's possible that the fixture wasn't installed correctly. Adjusting it may correct the issue before you spend money on a water pressure pump.

### Clogged Pipes

When hair, baby wipes and other materials clog your pipes, [water can't flow freely](https://www.portland.gov/water/report-water-quality-issues/water-pressure-and-flow), resulting in reduced water pressure. Before you purchase a water pressure booster for your home, have a plumber make sure that your pipes are clear. If you have a clog, clear it before you do any other plumbing updates.

### Undersized Pipes

If your pipes are too small to accommodate your family's needs, you may notice reduced water pressure in your home. In this case, you need to replace the undersized pipes before you think about installing a water pressure booster pump.

It's also important to check your shut-off valve, as it may be partially closed, limiting the flow of water through your plumbing system. This is an easy problem to fix, as all you have to do is open the valve all the way.<br><iframe title="YouTube video player" width="1072" height="603" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VLcaeWk-vh0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen title="Your Shower Head Needs a Bath #lifehack #cleaninghack #howto"></iframe>
