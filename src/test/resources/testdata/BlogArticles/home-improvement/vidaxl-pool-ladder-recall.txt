  [VidaXL](http://www.vidaxl.com/) is recalling about 3,200 above-ground pool ladders due to a fall hazard. The steps of the ladder can become loose, posing fall and drowning risks to the user. The Consumer Product Safety Commission is warning consumers to stop using the recalled ladders immediately.

According to the Nov. 12 [recall alert](https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2022/VidaXL-Recalls-Ladders-for-Above-Ground-Pools-Due-to-Fall-and-Drowning-Hazards-Recall-Alert), the Rialto, Calif.-based company has received four reports of incidents where the user fell off the ladder. No injuries have been reported.

This recall specifically the VidaXL stainless steel A-frame pool ladders with item numbers 93122 and 93188. You can find this number printed alongside the VidaXL.com logo on the horizontal bar of the A-frame.

The ladders were manufactured in China and sold online at [vidaxl.com](http://www.vidaxl.com/) from February 2021 through August 2021 for about $90.

If you own a recalled ladder, you should stop using it and contact VidaXL for instructions on how to destroy the product to receive a full refund. The company is contacting all known purchasers directly, telling consumers to remove and dispose of two of the ladder’s steps to render the product unusable.

To reach out to the company directly, call 1-888-854-0905, email [recall@vidaxl.com](mailto:recall@vidaxl.com) or visit the [website](https://www.vidaxl.com/product-recalls.html). For more consumer product safety information, go to [cpsc.gov](https://www.cpsc.gov/).
