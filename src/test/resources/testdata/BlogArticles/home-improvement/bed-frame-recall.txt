  If you purchased a Bed Tech-brand HR Platform bed frame in roughly the past year, you’re going to want to see if you’re impacted by a new federal safety action. Global Home Imports Inc. is recalling some 82,000 of the product due to a defect that could allow the bed frames to collapse while occupied, posing a crushing hazard that could result in “severe injury or death.” While the Phoenix-based company has received 100 reports of the frames collapsing, no injuries have been reported.

The Consumer Product Safety Commission [announced the recall on March 17](https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2021/Global-Home-Imports-Recalls-Platform-Bed-Frames-Due-to-Serious-Injury-Hazard), covering frame sizes twin, twin XL, full, queen, king and California king sold for around $200 between April 2020 and January 2021 at American Furniture Warehouse, Mattress Firm, and other furniture and mattress stores across the country.

“Consumers should immediately stop using the recalled HR Platform Frames and contact Global Home Imports to receive a free repair kit with metal clips to strengthen the frame,” the CPSC stated. “Global Home Imports will ship a kit directly to consumers free of charge.”

The Vietnam-manufactured bed frames were sold under the Bed Tech brand name, and feature black steel frames and blue plastic clips. Recalled frames bear the model numbers HR33, HR33XL, HR46, HR50, HR60 and HR66, printed on the outside leg along with the 14-digit serial number. [Go here to order your free repair kit](https://highriserecall.com), which includes one set of metal clips (the amount needed for each frame you own), allowing seven to 10 days for delivery.
