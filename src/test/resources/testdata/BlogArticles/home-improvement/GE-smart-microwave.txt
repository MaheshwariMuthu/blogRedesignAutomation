Wi-Fi connectivity makes your microwave more efficient and easier to use. Here’s what to know about GE smart microwaves.

What Is a Smart Microwave?
--------------------------

Smart microwaves are modern kitchen appliances that connect to your home Wi-Fi network and provide extra functionality to make cooking more convenient. The app installed on your phone or tablet lets you control the microwave from anywhere, and voice assistant capability makes it possible to use voice commands to start or stop the microwave using your Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant when you're busy taking care of other kitchen tasks. Both over-the-range and countertop models are available, making it easy to find a smart microwave that works for your kitchen.

What Features Does the GE Smart Microwave Have?
-----------------------------------------------

A [GE smart microwave](https://www.geappliances.com/appliance/GE-0-9-Cu-Ft-Capacity-Smart-Countertop-Microwave-Oven-with-Scan-To-Cook-Technology-JES1097SMSS) has all the features that a regular microwave does, plus Wi-Fi connectivity. Internet access lets your microwave connect with your phone or voice assistant, so you can monitor timers and track cooking progress from anywhere in the house. The GE smart microwave also features scan-to-cook technology. With this feature, you can scan the barcodes on thousands of frozen or packaged foods and get precisely timed cooking without having to adjust the settings or guess at the right amount of time needed.

All the regular microwave features are also included, so your smart GE microwave has a turntable for even cooking, automatic and manual controls to allow for one-touch cooking and defrosting or precise programming when you need it. Control lockouts help prevent accidental operation, and a kitchen timer keeps you on task when you're preparing multiple dishes at once.

How Does the GE Smart Microwave Compare to Regular Microwaves?
--------------------------------------------------------------

While the GE smart microwave offers plenty of extra features that help you build a connected home, there are some things to think about before you head to the store to purchase one. One big decision when choosing a microwave is whether to go with a countertop or over-the-range microwave. As of late 2021, there are no smart GE over-the-range microwave ovens, so the only smart option from GE is the countertop microwave.

Microwave ovens generally [last from 9 to 10 years](https://www.digitaltrends.com/home/how-long-do-appliances-last/), but this may not hold true for smart microwaves. Because these microwaves require periodic software updates to continue functioning properly, there may be issues in the future if GE stops supporting the software for the microwave.

If you're shopping for a microwave with internet connectivity, you might also want to consider a Samsung smart microwave. Smart microwaves from Samsung feature many of the same options as GE microwaves and operate via an app. If you plan to connect multiple appliances, you may want to purchase smart appliances made by the same manufacturer so all of your devices can be operated via the same app.

How Do You Connect to the Microwave?
------------------------------------

To operate your smart GE microwave oven, download the free [SmartHQ app](https://www.geappliances.com/connect) onto a phone or tablet. The app is available on both the Apple App store and Google Play store. Using the app, you can connect and control all of your smart GE appliances, including your microwave.<br><iframe title="YouTube video player" width="1072" height="603" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ByKX1s5TgBY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
