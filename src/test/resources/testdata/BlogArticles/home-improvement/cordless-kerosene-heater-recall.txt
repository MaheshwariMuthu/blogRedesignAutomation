According to [the manufacturer](https://www.mrheater.com/recall), the DeWALT cordless kerosene forced-air heaters can restart unexpectedly from standby mode if the room temperature drops below what is set on the thermostat. In addition to creating a fire hazard, this may also pose a risk of carbon monoxide poisoning.

The recall was [announced Feb. 3](https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2021/Enerco-Group-Recalls-DeWALT-Cordless-Kerosene-Heaters-Due-to-Fire-and-Carbon-Monoxide-Poisoning-Hazards). The affected heaters with model number DXH90CFAK have serial numbers 340902-20001001 through 340902-20004000. Those with model number DXH90CFAKM have serial numbers 340901-20001001 through 340901-20001500. You can find the model and serial number on the heater’s side panel.

According to the [Consumer Product Safety Commission](https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2021/Enerco-Group-Recalls-DeWALT-Cordless-Kerosene-Heaters-Due-to-Fire-and-Carbon-Monoxide-Poisoning-Hazards), Enerco has received one report of the issue. No injuries have been reported. The forced-air heaters, which sell for about $350, were manufactured in China and were sold at Lowe’s stores, and at farm and supply stores nationwide.
