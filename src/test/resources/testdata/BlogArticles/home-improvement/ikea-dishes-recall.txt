  IKEA is recalling about 148,000 plates, bowls and mugs due to a burn hazard. According to a May 19 recall alert from the [Consumer Product Safety Commission](https://cpsc.gov/Recalls/2021/IKEA-Recalls-Bowls-Plates-and-Mugs-Due-to-Burn-Hazard), the dishes can become brittle and break, causing hot food or liquid to leak out.

IKEA has received 123 reports of such incidents worldwide. There have been four reports of injuries — most of them burns caused by hot contents — two of which required medical attention. One incident, without injury, has been reported in the U.S.

The HEROISK and TALRIKA lines of bowls, plates and mugs are involved in this recall. Recalled units have supplier number “23348,” “Made in Taiwan” and “PLA” molded into the bottom of the item.

The dishes were imported by IKEA Supply AG of Switzerland. They were sold between August 2019 and May 2021 at IKEA stores nationwide and online at ikea-usa.com for $4 to $12. Additionally, about 11,400 units were sold in Canada.
