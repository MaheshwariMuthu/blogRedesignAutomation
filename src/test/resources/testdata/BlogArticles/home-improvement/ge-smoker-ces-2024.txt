  _Smoking or non?_ These days, one of the few places where you might still be asked this question is Las Vegas, Nevada. This town is also home to CES (formerly the Consumer Electronics Show), where GE has announced the launch of its brand-new _indoor_ smoker, a countertop appliance.

The GE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker purports to be a first-of-its-kind electric appliance that brings the fun and flavor of an outdoor smoker to your kitchen. The smoker uses smoke from real wood — just like an _outdoor_ smoker — and precision controls and smoke settings allow you to season your food to your liking. Instead of setting off your smoke alarms, the airflow system and Active Smoke Filtration technology keep any smoky fumes sealed inside the appliance.

The system connects to the SmartHQ app, the platform used by GE for its other smart appliances. Anyone who’s ever used an outdoor smoker knows that smoking food is something of a waiting game. So, the app allows you to check the status of your food remotely. You can also change up the settings on the app so your meat’s ready when you are. According to GE, the connected appliance can receive over-the-air updates for increased functionality in the future.

This smoker could be a good option for those who want to dip their toes into smoking but aren’t ready to — or living situations don’t allow them to — get an outdoor rig. Six built-in presets make it easy to get started, even if you don’t know much about smoking. That said, GE says the customizable settings are great for experienced smokers.
