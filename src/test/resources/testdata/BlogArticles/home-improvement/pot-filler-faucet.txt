A pot filler faucet, which is essentially a water faucet over the stove, can be a lifesaver to anyone with a bad back or a love of pasta — or both.

What Is a Pot Filler Faucet?
----------------------------

A pot filler faucet is a single-armed spigot that's mounted on the wall over a stove. These compact fixtures are designed to help cooks easily fill pots with water right on their cooktops. Pot fillers come in various lengths, styles and finishes, and they may be centered or offset, depending on aesthetic preference and the intended use. They typically have jointed arms that extend, so you can easily fill pots without spilling water on your range.

How Does a Pot Filler Faucet Work?
----------------------------------

Pot fillers are mounted above the stove, and their extendable arms can often reach pots on all the appliance's burners. To fill a pot, simply extend the arm until it's positioned appropriately, and then turn on the water using the attached or nearby valve. Pot fillers are typically single-temperature fixtures, so you won't have to adjust from hot to cold (or vice versa).

Once the pot is filled to the desired level, turn off the water using the same valve. Then, fold the arm back so it rests flat against the wall or backsplash until it's needed again.

*   Stove faucets

Are There Benefits to Having a Pot Filler Faucet?
-------------------------------------------------

Pot filler faucets can be a welcome convenience for home cooks, saving time and minimizing the need to carry heavy, water-filled pots. Besides being a practical addition, pot fillers can add a sense of sophistication and luxury to a kitchen's design. Plus, because pot fillers aren't standard fare in most home kitchens, a high-end fixture can add to the resale value of a house.

However, there are disadvantages to installing a pot filler. They can be costly, and pot filler installation usually must be done by a licensed plumbing professional. Wall-mounted pot fillers also need to be cleaned regularly due to splatters of grease and cooking food.<br><iframe title="YouTube video player" width="1072" height="603" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5j759jOLiwc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen title="How to Retrieve a Wedding Ring that Went Down the Drain | 5 Steps"></iframe>
