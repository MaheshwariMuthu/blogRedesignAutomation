  Chicago-based Kolcraft Enterprises Inc. is recalling 51,000 baby cradle accessories due to risk of infant suffocation death. The recalled component is the inclined sleeper accessory included with Kolcraft Cuddle ’n Care 2-in-1 Bassinet & Incline Sleepers as well as with Preferred Position 2-in-1 Bassinet & Incline Sleepers. The sleepers were sold between March 2011 and December 2017, for about $140 apiece, nationwide, the [Consumer Product Safety Commission](https://cpsc.gov/Recalls/2021/Kolcraft-Reannounces-Recall-of-Inclined-Sleeper-Accessory-and-Urges-Consumers-to-Act-Now-to-Prevent-Risk-of-Suffocation) reported.

No incidents or injuries have been reported stemming from the recalled Kolcraft products, which were manufactured in China, but deaths have been attributed to similar products.

“Infant fatalities have been reported with other manufacturers’ inclined sleep products, after the infants rolled from their back to their stomach or side, or under other circumstances,” the CPSC stated.

The recall — initially announced Feb. 20, 2020, then re-announced May 5, 2021 — affects the inclined sleeper accessory of Kolcraft Cuddle ’n Care 2-in-1 Bassinet & Incline Sleepers bearing a model number starting with KB063 as well as Preferred Position 2-in-1 Bassinet & Incline Sleepers bearing a model number starting with KB061. Model numbers can be found on the metal bar between the bassinets’ legs. Owners should note that only the inclined sleeper accessory is affected by the recall, not the entire bassinet; the bassinet can still be used without the inclined sleeper.

Owners should stop using the accessory immediately and contact Kolcraft for either a $20 refund or a $35 voucher for products on the [company’s website](http://www.kolcraft.com/), which can be used until Feb. 20, 2022.

Kolcraft is contacting all registered owners and known purchasers directly via a mailed postcard; owners can call the company at 800-453-7673, email [customerservice@kolcraft.com](mailto:customerservice@kolcraft.com) or go to the [product recall page](https://www.kolcraft.com/safety-notifications/kolcraft-inclined-sleeper-assembly/) on the company’s website.
