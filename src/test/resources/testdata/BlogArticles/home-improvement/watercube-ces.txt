  Home backup generators are so common for a reason: We don’t like to go without electricity for long. In some cases, it can actually be _dangerous_ for your home — like if your sump pump goes out during a rainstorm. But a power outage is one thing; what happens if water scarcity in your area leaves you without access to Earth’s most vital resource?

That’s the problem [Genesis Systems](https://genesissystems.com) hopes to solve with its WaterCube, an atmospheric water generator that pulls water out of thin air — literally. In Las Vegas, a town known for such magic tricks, the WaterCube is on display at CES 2024 (formerly the Consumer Electronics Show), along with hundreds of other brand-new products and innovations in smart-home gadgets and home appliances.

The WaterCube is the world’s first home water-from-air generator rated to produce 100 gallons of water per day.

“The WaterCube is meant to give people water resilience,” said Shannon Stuckenberg, CEO of Genesis Systems. “It’s water your way.”

According to Genesis Systems, the Water Cube uses proprietary technology to pull in air, remove the water from the air, filter the water and then send it out. Tanks in the bottom of the generator can store water for later use. The water is filtered, so it’s drinkable, or you can use it for anything else you might need water for.

The Water Cube is a 100-gallon model, and it can produce enough water for about four people. According to Genesis Systems, the system can produce more water in higher-humidity environments.

For greater water needs, the capacity can be increased by combining multiple WaterCubes together. The system can run continuously to provide water — say, for an off-grid solution — or it can be used on-demand. Genesis Systems also makes the [WC-1000](https://genesissystems.com/wc-1000-watercube/), a model typically used in commercial applications that converts air into 1,000 to 5,000 gallons per day.

The WaterCube received a CES 2024 Innovation Awards honor in the Smart Home category. The CES Innovation Awards is a competition put on each year by the Consumer Technology Association that honors products in 29 categories for “outstanding design and engineering.” This year, competition was stiff; CTA reported receiving over 3,000 product submissions.

Genesis Systems is now accepting preorders for the WC-100 WaterCube product. The retail price will be $19,995, but they can be reserved with a refundable $500 deposit.<br><iframe title="YouTube video player" width="1072" height="603" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/E7N374KASqs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen title="Eco-friendly laundry hack!"></iframe>
