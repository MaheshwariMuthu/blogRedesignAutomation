While it might seem silly to hire an HVAC technician to perform regular HVAC tune-ups, that service could save you a lot of money and stress in the long run.

What Are the Benefits of Properly Maintaining Your HVAC System?
---------------------------------------------------------------

When your budget is already tight, and your schedule is busy, it might be tempting to skip HVAC maintenance. But it could help you keep your system running better and save you money. You can perform some maintenance tasks, such as changing the filter and cleaning the unit, but it's also important to schedule annual tune-ups with a professional HVAC technician. Here's why.

### 1\. Improved System Efficiency

When you don't take care of your heating and cooling equipment, it has to work a lot harder to keep your home comfortable. This can happen if the parts inside get dirty and can't work as well or if parts start to wear out and interfere with operations. When an HVAC pro performs a tune-up, they clean out the system and lubricate moving parts, so they can glide easily with less wear. If they find minor issues that are affecting efficiency, they can fix them to restore peak efficiency.

### 2\. Lower Utility Bills

Using less energy to heat and cool your home is great for the environment, but it's also a nice bonus for your bank account. When your equipment works efficiently, you'll pay less for your utilities. Keeping an eye on your power bills can help you monitor the health of your HVAC equipment. If you notice your bills increasing, it could mean it's working harder than it should due to a hidden issue.

### 3\. Fewer Repair Calls

Sure, you have to pay for a tune-up — you can expect to pay around $170 (CAD 226) for [HVAC maintenance costs](https://howmuch.net/costs/annual-air-conditioner-maintenance). But it could save you on more costly repairs in the future. Taking care of the system can prevent excess wear and damage to parts, which can help you avoid lots of repairs. For example, a dirty air filter can reduce airflow, make the system work harder and damage parts.

The repairs that result from lack of maintenance can be expensive. For instance, leak repair can range from $300 to $1,000 (CAD 398 to CAD 1,328). Replacement condenser coils usually cost between $500 and $750 (CAD 663 and CAD 996). Maintenance might not prevent all repairs, but it can reduce your risks of more expensive repair services.

### 4. Longer Life

Just like a well-maintained car usually carries you through a lot more road trips, maintaining your heating and cooling system helps it last longer. Tune-ups reduce the strain on your system by helping it work optimally. Less strain means the internal parts should hold out longer. That means you can hold on to your equipment a little longer before you have to invest a lot of money into a new unit.

### 5\. Satisfying Warranty Requirements

If you have a newer HVAC system, tune-ups might not be optional if you want to keep your warranty coverage. Many manufacturers require you to get annual checkups from a professional HVAC technician to keep the warranty in effect. Since it's a good way to prevent issues, the manufacturer does this as a way to minimize potential repairs.

### 6\. Improved Safety

During an HVAC tune-up, a series of safety checks are performed to make sure everything is working correctly. Issues with the equipment can cause carbon monoxide leaks, gas leaks or electrical fires, which can all be potentially deadly. An HVAC technician checks for situations that could cause those safety risks and provides repair solutions to keep your home and family safe.

### 7\. Better Indoor Air Quality

All the air in your home circulates through your HVAC system. Keeping the equipment in good working order can help you breathe a little easier with healthier indoor air. When the system works correctly, it pulls dirt, pet dander and other contaminants from the air with the air filter. It also helps control humidity in your home, which contributes to comfort and prevents mold buildup.
