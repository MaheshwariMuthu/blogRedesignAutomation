  Did you purchase a Casa Kids Cabina Bunk Bed between April 2018 and November 2020? If so, you’ll want to check whether it has a screw loose. Casa Kids has recalled some of these bunk beds because the screws do not hold the bed rails securely in place. About 195 units are affected by this recall. Read on to find out if yours is one of them.

According to the Brooklyn, N.Y.-based [manufacturer](https://casakids.com/pages/productrecall), the screws in some Cabina Bunk Beds do not tighten the mattress foundation to the guardrail. Instead, the screws will spin or appear loose. The [Consumer Product Safety Commission](https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2021/Casa-Kids-Recalls-for-Repair-Cabina-Bunk-Beds-Due-to-Fall-Hazard-Recall-Alert) warns that the unsecured mattress foundation can fall, posing a risk of injury to children in the bed.

The recall, announced March 4, affects bunk beds manufactured in February 2018, June 2018, May 2019 and December 2019. To find the date your bed was manufactured, check the label on the bottom of the headboard panel.

The Cabina Bunk Beds were made in Latvia and sold online at the Casa Kids website between April 2018 and November 2020, at a price of around $1,500. Casa Kids has received nine reports of loose screws, the [CPSC](https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2021/Casa-Kids-Recalls-for-Repair-Cabina-Bunk-Beds-Due-to-Fall-Hazard-Recall-Alert) reports. In one case, the mattress foundation on the lower bunk separated from one of the bed rails. No injuries have been reported.

If your bunk bed has been recalled, stop using it immediately and inspect the screws following the instructions listed [here](https://casakids.com/pages/productrecall). If the screws spin and do not tighten, contact the manufacturer for replacement screws. Casa Kids is contacting all customers directly to provide inspection and repair instructions.

You can reach Casa Kids at 718-694-0272, via email at [casa@casakids.com](mailto:casa@casakids.com) or through their [product recall](https://casakids.com/pages/productrecall) page. For more consumer product safety information, go to [cpsc.gov](https://www.cpsc.gov/).
