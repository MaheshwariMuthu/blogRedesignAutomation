According to the Nov. 18 [recall alert](https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2022/Amazon-Recalls-AmazonBasics-Mattresses-Due-to-Violation-of-Federal-Flammability-Standard-Recall-Alert) from the Consumer Product Safety Commission, this recall involves AmazonBasics Memory Foam Mattresses in 10- and 12-inch thicknesses. They were sold in twin, full, queen, king and California king sizes. Affected mattresses have “amazonbasics” printed on the foot panel.

The mattresses were manufactured in Malaysia and sold on [Amazon.com](http://Amazon.com) between April 2020 and March 2021 for $150 to $450.

To remedy the issue, Amazon is sending buyers a free mattress cover. This will bring the mattress into compliance with the federal standard. Amazon is contacting all purchasers directly, but you can reach out to the Seattle, Wash.-based company by calling 877-444-3765. You can register your product [here](https://www.amazonmattressrecall.expertinquiry.com).
