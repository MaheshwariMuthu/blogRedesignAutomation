  Target is recalling about 58,500 Room Essentials shower stools. If you purchased one of these stools between March 2019 and September 2020, it might be affected by this recall. According to a [recall alert](https://cpsc.gov/Recalls/2021/Target-Recalls-Shower-Stools-Due-to-Fall-Hazard-Sold-Exclusively-at-Target) published May 26 by the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the stools can become unstable during use, causing them to tip over and posing a fall hazard.

The CPSC reports that there have been 12 reports of the consumers falling off the stools, including four reports of bruises, bumps and scratches. One user reported a sprained arm.

This recall involves Target’s Room Essentials-branded shower stools. The 18-inch-tall stools are white, have aluminum legs and are topped with a plastic, curved seat. The recalled models have item number 064-20-1091 printed on the tag. The stools were made in China and sold exclusively at Target stores nationwide and Target.com for about $35.

If you have one of these stools in your shower, you’ll want to stop using it immediately. You can return the stool to any Target store or contact Target for a full refund. You can reach the Minneapolis, Minn.-based company at 800-440-0680 or online at [Target.com.](http://www.target.com/) For more details, visit Target’s [recalls page](https://help.target.com/help/productrecallpage?childcat=Product+recalls&parentcat=Product+Safety+%26+Recalls&searchQuery=search+help) and use the “Home” dropdown menu to find the “Target Room Essentials Shower Stools” entry.
