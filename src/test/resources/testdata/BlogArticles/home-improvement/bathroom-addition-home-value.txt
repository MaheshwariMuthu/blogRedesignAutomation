So, how much does a bathroom remodel or addition cost? When remodeling an existing bathroom, the total cost depends on existing fixtures and fittings and the luxury rating of the finished product.

Those in the market to buy a home notice bathrooms. The more and the higher the quality, the better.

Updating an Existing Bathroom
-----------------------------

When remodeling an existing bathroom, it's important to consider factors such as the condition of current plumbing, fixtures, electrical components and the layout of the room. Choosing to remodel an existing shower is a great way to add luxury without tackling the cost of a full remodel and taking on such a large project. According to [Architectural Digest](https://www.architecturaldigest.com/reviews/home-improvement/bathroom-remodel-cost), the average total cost for a shower remodel is $4,000 to $12,000 (CAD 5,450 to CAD 16,350), with the final cost depending on the size and features of the finished product. On the low end, prefabricated shower kits start from around $500 (CAD 680).

Installing a shower may be a great way to make use of existing space. Expect a walk-in shower to cost anywhere from $8,500 to $20,000 (CAD 11,585 to CAD 27,250). Bathtub-to-shower conversions range from $1,100 to $7,000 (CAD 1,500 to CAD 9,540). Walk-in showers can be more expensive due to the tile installation, which can range from $1 to $25 (CAD 1.35 to CAD 35) per square foot. Adding a [showerhead costs](https://porch.com/project-cost/cost-to-install-a-shower-head) anywhere from $81 to $218 (CAD 110 to CAD 297), and a [shower door](https://homeguide.com/costs/glass-shower-door-cost) will add another $400 to $1,900 (CAD 545 to CAD 2,590).

Wet Rooms
---------

Wet rooms are the most expensive bathroom upgrades due to the tile required and the labor involved. Because wet rooms are designed for everything to get wet, extra waterproofing also adds to the cost.

However, there are many positives associated with wet rooms. They are easy to clean, excellent for small spaces, easily accessible for those with mobility issues and improve resale value. Expect to see a higher return on your investment when selling a home with a wet room. Converting a regular bathroom to a wet room costs $10,000 to $20,000 (CAD 13,600 to CAD 27,250) on average and can realize an investment return of 56% to 70%, according to [Fixr](https://www.fixr.com/comparisons/wet-room-vs-traditional-bathroom).

Personal Return on Investment
-----------------------------

For those planning to remain in their home for many years, the personal enjoyment of a bathroom improvement may mean more than the financial return.

A master suite with a luxurious bathroom may appeal to you, especially if you spend a lot of time there. Relaxation is priceless. A master bath with a large soaking tub can relieve mountains of stress. The waterfall head in a tile walk-in shower may appeal to those with a love of the outdoors.

Whatever your style, you must determine if the end investment is worth the upfront cost. Considering improvements that best suit your lifestyle is an excellent place to begin when considering a remodel or addition.

Homeowners who don't plan to live in their homes long-term or those who don't think they'd take advantage of extra amenities may want to take a closer look at cost. The investment may not be worth it to them from a financial standpoint.
