According to the [Consumer Product Safety Commission](https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2021/edsal-recalls-2-2-million-shelving-units-due-to-injury-hazard), the affected units’ plywood shelves may not withstand the 800-pound weight limit, which is printed on the packaging. The shelves can break or bend when loaded with heavy items, posing a risk of injury if the items fall.

The recall was announced Feb. 10. The affected units have five tiers of plywood shelving and gray or black steel frames. Units with these model numbers have been recalled: CR3618 and CR3618-BLK, which measure 72 inches high and 18 inches deep; and CR4824 and CR4824-BLK, measuring 72 inches high and 24 inches deep.

According to the [CPSC](https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2021/edsal-recalls-2-2-million-shelving-units-due-to-injury-hazard), Edsal has received seven reports of shelves bending or breaking under heavy items. One injury has been reported; a user suffered a broken toe after the unit broke and items fell.

The shelving units were manufactured in the United States. They were sold online at Amazon.com, Staples.com, Walmart.com and other retailers between January 2015 and September 2020, for $80 to $90.
