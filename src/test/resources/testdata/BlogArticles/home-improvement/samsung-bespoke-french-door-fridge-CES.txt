Do you like to keep up with the trends but add your own personal style to it? Samsung sees you, you [beautiful and unique snowflake](https://youtu.be/3CnryN0_bvY).

No longer must you choose between white, black or stainless steel. The brand-new model takes the [most fashionable fridge style](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/the-best-refrigerator/#door-styles-french-doors-lead-in-popularity-and-satisfaction) for American kitchens today and allows buyers to make it their very own by choosing from among potentially thousands of color and finish combinations to match your individual preferences. The French-door offering joins other styles in Samsung’s Bespoke fridge lineup, which already includes the 4-Door Flex, Bespoke 2-Door Bottom Freezer and Bespoke 1-Door Flex Column, in addition to other household appliances such as dishwashers, ranges, microwaves, laundry machines and vacuum cleaners.

“Available in a range of sizes, configurations and colors, Samsung’s Bespoke French Door refrigerator brings Bespoke customization and a sleek flat-front design to the U.S. consumers’ most preferred refrigerator type,” a statement from Samsung said.

Here are seven things you need to know about the Samsung Bespoke French Door fridge:

1\. There Are Multiple Models

It’ll be offered in a choice of three-door, four-door and connected Family Hub models, as well as in both full and counter-depth configurations.

2\. Choice of Two Finishes
--------------------------

A couple of available finishes include glass and steel.

3\. A Few New Hues

Among a total of a dozen new colors across the range, glass-finish color options include White, Gray, Pink, Charcoal, Morning Blue, Clementine and Sunrise Yellow. New steel-finish color offerings include Tuscan, Matte Black, Navy, Emerald Green and Stainless Steel.

4\. It’s Got Flavor
-------------------

It features Samsung’s cleverly concealed [Beverage Center](https://www.samsung.com/us/support/answer/ANS00088582/) with the AutoFill water pitcher, which allows users to add flavors such as lemon slices or tea leaves to their chilled water via an infuser that steeps the ingredients throughout the day. That's in addition to a conventional filtered water dispenser.

5\. Twice the Ice
-----------------

The [Dual Auto Ice Maker](https://m.facebook.com/home.php) offers two types of ice: cubed on one side, crushed on the other.

6\. Cool Flex!

Prepare to enter … the [FlexZone](https://www.samsung.com/africa_en/support/home-appliances/using-the-flex-zone/)! No, this is _not_ the big mirror with the good light at your fitness club. According to Samsung, it’s a full-width drawer with an adjustable temperature control you can use for “large party trays, deli items, wines, pizzas, beverages, or miscellaneous items.” A temperature sensor lets users adjust the amount of cold air allowed into the “zone” via control buttons offering temperature presets for modes that, on other models, have included Meat/Fish, Cold Drinks, Deli/Snack and Wine/Party Dishes.

7\. All the Hub-bub

For 2022, the Family Hub connected capabilities will support Samsung TV Plus, providing free TV content and continuous viewing with other Samsung smart devices like TVs and Galaxy phones.

“Family Hub for 2022 will also support Alexa in select regions, meaning consumers can access various Amazon services, including Amazon Music and smart water filter reordering services, on their refrigerators,” Samsung said in a statement. “View Inside has also been upgraded with internal camera technology for utilizing information on food labels, allowing families to view fridge contents, manage expiration dates, and more.”<br><iframe title="YouTube video player" width="1072" height="603" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2aLs7X_hMxU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
