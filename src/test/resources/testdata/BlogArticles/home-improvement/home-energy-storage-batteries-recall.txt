According to the Consumer Product Safety Commission, there have been five reported incidents of the batteries smoking and catching on fire, resulting in property damage and, in one case, an unspecified injury.

The Aug. 4 [recall announcement](https://cpsc.gov/Recalls/2021/LG-Energy-Solution-Michigan-Recalls-Home-Energy-Storage-Batteries-Due-to-Fire-Hazard-0) says these batteries were manufactured in Korea and sold between January 2017 and April 2019 by various solar energy storage distributors nationwide, like Sunrun, AEE Solar, CED and others, listed [here](https://cpsc.gov/Recalls/2021/LG-Energy-Solution-Michigan-Recalls-Home-Energy-Storage-Batteries-Due-to-Fire-Hazard-0).

This recall affects the LG Chem Model RESU 10H lithium-ion batteries. They were likely installed as part of your home energy solar panel system, allowing you to store energy from your solar panels. The wall-mounted units have a serial number starting with R15563P3, which can be found behind the access door.

In addition, about 1,800 LG Chem Model RESU 10H (Type-R) home batteries were also recalled for a fire hazard in December 2020. Read that recall announcement [here](https://cpsc.gov/Recalls/2021/LG-Energy-Solution-Michigan-Recalls-Home-Energy-Storage-Batteries-Due-to-Fire-Hazard).

If these recalled batteries are installed in your home, LG Energy Solution Michigan says you are eligible for a free replacement. Contact the Holland, Mich.-based company to schedule service. If your batteries are connected online, LG Energy Solution Michigan will arrange for modifications to reduce the risk of overheating until they can be replaced.

The company is attempting to contact known owners directly.
