  A smart new front door can give your home's curb appeal a significant boost. Apart from improving your home's outward appearance, there are plenty of other reasons that a new front door could be a sound investment, including increased energy efficiency and security.

If you're considering upgrading your front door, you've probably wondered if doing so could add value to your house. Find the answer below.

How Much Value Does a New Front Door Add?
-----------------------------------------

According to [Quality Overhead Door](https://www.qualityoverheaddoor.com/blog/how-your-front-door-and-garage-door-can-increase-home-value/), a new front door offers a potential return-on-investment of around 75%. In other words, you’ll recoup about 75% of what you spend on a new front door in the form of home value.

How much a new front door will increase your home's value depends on how much the new door costs and how attractive it is to potential buyers. Therefore, you could get a higher ROI by purchasing a stylish front door than with a basic model that doesn't have much impact on your home's curb appeal.

You should also carefully consider the color of your new front door if maximum ROI is important to you. A [2018 analysis by Zillow](http://zillow.mediaroom.com/2018-06-20-Homes-with-Tuxedo-Kitchen-Cabinets-and-Black-Front-Doors-Can-Sell-Up-to-6-000-More-than-Expected) found that black or charcoal gray front doors had the greatest positive impact on home value. In fact, houses with these door colors sold for up to $6,000 more than the expected selling price. While a bright front door could add a pleasant pop of color to your home's facade, it's a riskier choice in terms of potential ROI.

Is a New Front Door a Good Investment?
--------------------------------------

A new front door is a good investment because it will increase your home's value, especially if you choose a door with mass appeal. Adding to your home's curb appeal could also attract potential buyers as they pass your house, making it easier to sell. You'll also benefit from an improved facade even if you don't intend to sell anytime soon because it will be more welcoming for your family and guests.

Replacing your front door is a particularly sound investment if your existing door looks worse for the wear. Cracked or peeling paint, rotten wood or damaged insulation don't give a great first impression to visitors, and it's not what you want when you're trying to sell your home as your front door is the first part of your home potential buyers see. An old or damaged front door can give a negative impression of how well you care for your house, and buyers may be put off as they'll need to pay to replace it themselves when they move in.

Finally, a new door will improve your home's energy efficiency compared to an old, drafty door with damaged weatherstripping. A well-insulated door will save you money while you continue to live in your home by reducing your utilities. Also, energy-efficient homes are more attractive to buyers because they cost less to heat.

How Much Should You Spend on a Front Door?
------------------------------------------

There are two costs to consider when you're thinking about replacing your front door: the costs of the door itself and installation costs. While you don't need to break the bank to get a decent front door, the cheapest white, uPVC doors may not do much for your house value as they don't have the same curb appeal as fiberglass or wooden doors.

On average, you should expect to spend $1,100 to $1,550 for a wooden door and $1,800 to $3,500 for a fiberglass door, according to [Remodeling Costs](https://www.remodelingcosts.org/exterior-door-cost/). This price includes installation. If your door frame is damaged, you'll also need to factor in the costs of door frame repair. You can save some money by installing the door yourself if you have the DIY skills. However, hiring a professional will be significantly quicker and comes with the added advantage of a warranty.
