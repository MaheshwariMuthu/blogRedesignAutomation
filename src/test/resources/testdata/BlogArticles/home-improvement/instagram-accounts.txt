Staying at home during the coronavirus has fueled my Instagram habit...big time! Lots of free time, means lots of sharing on the super popular, 10 year old, photo-sharing app. (Insta, once beloved by hipsters, but now used by almost everyone, was just a wee San Fran start-up company back in 2010, and now has [more than 500 million daily active users](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/instagram-stats&targetText=With%20more%20than%20500%20million,have%20a%20presence%20on%20Instagram.#targetText=The%20Ultimate%20List%20of%20Instagram%20Stats%20%5B2019%5D{target="_blank"}).)

## Renovation raconteurs

If you have a big home renovation on the horizon or are seriously considering one, these three accounts may be right up your alley:

[@mrkate](https://www.instagram.com/mrkate/){target="_blank"}: Nearly a million Instagram followers (plus 3.5 million on her Creative Weirdos [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/){target="_blank"} channel) go to Mr. Kate for home renovation advice, including room-specific ideas and broad-scale advice on which design aesthetics to follow.
[@arrowsandbow](https://www.instagram.com/arrowsandbow/){target="_blank"}: Ashley Petrone, the interior designer behind this account, aims to illustrate her personality (and that of her family) through design choices, particularly furniture. Especially recommended if you want a beach-house vibe for your house or are considering something like an outdoor kitchen.
[@conklinhouse](https://www.instagram.com/conklinhouse/){target="_blank"}: Fans of home renovation approaches that are modernist-leaning (and more than a little bit quirky) should check out Clare Conklin's Instagram - for example, house numbers used as dresser drawer handles!

## DIY details

Driven to do more with less (as in spending less money) in your renovations? If so, check out these Instagramers:

::: list-square
* [@younghouselove](https://www.instagram.com/younghouselove/){target="_blank"}: This account documents the tribulations of Sherry Petersik and her partner John as they go about radically renovating their year-round home as well as two beach houses that have definitely seen better days. Great for motivation if you're mired in a long improvement process that sometimes doesn't feel like it's going to end.
* [@angelarosehome](https://www.instagram.com/angelarosehome/){target="_blank"}: Renovation doesn't have to break the bank to effectively and creatively spruce up your home, a fact that designer Angela Rose truly takes to heart in her celebration of innovative and [affordable DIY home improvement](/en-us/blog/home-improvement/cheap-ideas){target="_blank"} solutions.
* [@sugarandcloth](https://www.instagram.com/sugarandcloth/){target="_blank"}: Ashley Rose - no relation to the aforementioned Angela - specializes in trendy, smart _(some might say hipster)_ aesthetics for her various home design and crafting ideas, but explains how her followers can do similarly crafty things with design through DIY ingenuity and force of will.

## Specific style showcases

Does your home renovation project have a specific architectural style? Look to the following accounts for some relevant advice and inspiration:

::: list-square
* [@francois_et_moi](https://www.instagram.com/francois_et_moi/){target="_blank"}: Tudor style isn't what anyone would consider an _en vogue_ home aesthetic, but Erin Francois is working overtime to bring her interior into the 21st century. Her account is great for color scheme and accent ideas.
* [@renovating.no.66](https://www.instagram.com/renovating.no.66/){target="_blank"}: Take a (digital) trip across the pond to see how U.K. art teacher Rachael slowly but surely fixed up a Victorian home into a bespoke interior designer's dream.
* [@thegoldhive](https://www.instagram.com/thegoldhive/){target="_blank"}: As of September 2019, museum curator Ashley is still in the process of restoring a century-old Craftsman house in San Diego she bought in 2015. The photos are great, but her blog is also excellent for detailed, sensible home renovation ideas.
