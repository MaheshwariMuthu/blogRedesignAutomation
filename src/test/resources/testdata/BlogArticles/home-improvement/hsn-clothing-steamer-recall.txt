  HSN — formerly Home Shopping Network — has recalled over 5.4 million Joy/JM-branded handheld clothing steamers sold for nearly the past two decades due to what the Consumer Product Safety Commission has called a “serious burn hazard.” The steamers can spray or leak hot water, which may burn the user.

In the May 26 recall, the [CPSC](https://cpsc.gov/Recalls/2021/HSN-Recalls-5-4-Million-Handheld-Clothing-Steamers-Due-to-Serious-Burn-Hazard) reported that HSN has received 227 reports of hot water leaking or spraying from the recalled steamers, resulting in 106 reports of burn injuries. Of those reports, eight users suffered second-degree burns and six suffered third-degree burns.

The recall affects the full-size My Little Steamer and compact-size My Little Steamer Go Mini clothing steamers. They were sold individually or in combination sets. The recalled models have a flat or triangular head.

The steamers were manufactured in China and imported by Ingenious Designs of Ronkonkoma, N.Y., a wholly owned subsidiary of HSN. The devices were sold between January 2002 and December 2020 at HSN.com, the HSN TV network, and several stores and online retailers nationwide, including Amazon, Target, Bed Bath & Beyond, Walmart and Lowes. An additional 14,300 units were sold in Canada.
