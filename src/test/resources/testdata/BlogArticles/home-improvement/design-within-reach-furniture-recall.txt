According to the Oct. 28 [recall alert](https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2022/Design-Within-Reach-Recalls-Arc-Collection-Furniture-Due-to-Violation-of-the-Federal-Lead-Paint-Ban-Recall-Alert), the surface paint on the furniture pieces contains levels of lead that exceed amounts allowed under the [federal lead paint ban](https://www.cpsc.gov/Business--Manufacturing/Business-Education/Lead/Lead-in-Paint). This poses a risk of lead poisoning. The CPSC says lead is toxic if ingested by young children, and it can cause adverse health effects.

Design Within Reach of Stamford, Conn., has not received reports of injuries related to this recall.
