  Nothing beats the convenience of an at-home EV charging station. While never having to dash to the gas station again is a significant advantage, many homeowners forget to maintain their units. Regular EV charger maintenance is a must if you don't want to suddenly find yourself unable to charge your car and be liable for a hefty repair bill.

Fortunately, electric vehicle charger maintenance is easy and affordable, and you can perform basic checks in just a few minutes. Below, we'll outline what EV charger maintenance involves, how often to schedule maintenance and how much you should expect to spend.

How Do You Maintain a Home Electric Car Charging System?
--------------------------------------------------------

Electric vehicle charging station maintenance is relatively straightforward and helps you detect minor issues before they become expensive (potentially hazardous) problems. Your owner's manual may include maintenance instructions, and you should defer to the manufacturer's guidance. The following tips can help you keep your electric car charging station in good condition:

### 1\. Clean the Unit

First, clean the unit thoroughly to remove dust and debris. You should turn off the power to the EV charger at the breaker panel to prevent an electric shock and avoid using harsh cleaners and scrubbing pads. Generally, it's safe to use a solution made from a few drops of mild detergent mixed with warm water and applied with a soft cloth.

### 2\. Store the Cables Correctly

You should store the cables correctly after every use, following the manufacturer's guidelines. You'll usually need to either coil the cables or remove them. Caring for your cables appropriately can prevent fraying and minimize the risk of expensive repairs or replacements.

### 3\. Inspect the Cables

Inspect your cables regularly for signs of wear. Worn-out cables can affect charging times and may pose a fire hazard. Replace any frayed, loose or exposed wires before using your EV charger again.

### 4\. Monitor your EV Charging Station's Performance

Internal damage to your EV charging station can be harder to detect. Longer charging times or higher-than-usual operating costs are often signs of an electrical problem, so you should schedule maintenance if your charger stops functioning normally.

### 5\. Install a Cover

Outdoor charging stations are more prone to damage from extreme weather, temperature changes and falling debris. You can shield your charger from the elements by installing a protective cover.

Can You Maintain My EV Charging Station Yourself?
-------------------------------------------------

You can clean your electric vehicle charging station yourself and conduct basic checks for external damage and loose or frayed wires. However, it's worth scheduling professional EV charging station maintenance and repairs if you notice visible damage or performance issues.

A professional can diagnose hidden issues with your EV charging station and repair the unit. Repairing an EV charger yourself isn't usually worth it because you risk making the problem worse or voiding your warranty.

How Much Does Professional EV Charger Maintenance Cost?
-------------------------------------------------------

According to [ENERGY5](https://energy5.com/breaking-down-the-costs-of-maintaining-a-car-charging-station), Level 2 EV charging maintenance costs around $300 to $500 (CAD 396 to CAD 661) per year on average. Maintaining a Level 1 charger is significantly cheaper at around $200 to $300 (CAD 264 to CAD 396) per year.

How much it costs to maintain your EV charging station depends on several factors, including the unit's make, model and condition. If your unit develops a fault, it could cost significantly more to maintain because you'll need to schedule professional repairs.

How Often Should You Schedule EV Charging Station Maintenance?
--------------------------------------------------------------

Weekly preventative maintenance, such as cleaning and inspecting the unit yourself, can help you keep your EV charging station working properly and detect problems as early as possible. Some homeowners choose to enroll in a professional EV charger maintenance contract for regular services. Prices vary widely between companies, but buying a contract is often cheaper than booking one-off visits. Your provider can recommend the best maintenance schedule to keep your unit in good working order.

However, you should hire a professional to maintain your unit whenever you notice problems such as slow charging, unexplained hikes in your energy bills or visible damage to the cables. It's also wise to schedule electric vehicle charging station maintenance after extreme weather events, such as storms, hurricanes or heavy snow. Severe weather can damage your charging station, and these problems aren't always visible to the naked eye. A professional can thoroughly inspect your system and repair any damage to make it safe to use.
