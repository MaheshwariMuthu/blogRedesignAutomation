The recall, announced March 18, affects about 64,000 illu-Mist sprayers. The [Consumer Product Safety Commission](https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2021/HD-Hudson-Recalls-Battery-Powered-Sprayers-Due-to-Fire-Hazard) said the lithium-ion battery in the sprayer can overheat, posing a risk of fire. According to a statement from the [manufacturer](https://www.hdhudson.com/copy-of-hdhudson-recalls), the company has received a few reports of “batteries sparking or igniting, especially when stored or used improperly.”

The garden sprayers were made in China and sold nationwide in Lowe’s stores and online on Amazon.com for between $40 and $50 apiece. The recall affects both the 1-gallon and 2-gallon models, designated by the numbers 40001 and 40002, respectively. Affected sprayers have a gray handle and a white tank with “illu-Mist” printed on it.

According to the CPSC, there have been four reported incidents of the batteries overheating. In one case, the battery melted, caught fire and caused “less than $100 worth of property damage.” No injuries have been reported.

If you own one of the affected sprayers, HD Hudson recommends that you stop using it immediately. The Lowell, Mich.-based manufacturer said consumers should remove the battery tray on their unit and look for a brown battery; if the battery is brown, dispose of the battery and tray in accordance with local laws regarding lithium-ion batteries. Then, contact HD Hudson for a free replacement battery and tray; [replacement parts](https://www.hdhudson.com/copy-of-hdhudson-recalls) should arrive in one to two weeks.

You can call HD Hudson at 800-394-8802 or visit the [Recalls page](https://www.hdhudson.com/copy-of-hdhudson-recalls) on the company’s website. For more consumer product safety information, go to [cpsc.gov](https://www.cpsc.gov/).
