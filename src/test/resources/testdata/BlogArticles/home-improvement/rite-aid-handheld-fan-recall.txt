[Rite Aid](https://www.riteaid.com) has received two consumer reports of the fans overheating and smoking while charging. No injuries have been reported.

According to the Camp Hill, Pa.-based retailer, the recalled fans were manufactured in China and sold in Rite Aid stores between April 2021 and June 2021 for about $10. The affected models came in blue, pink and purple colors. Item number 9050103 is printed on a sticker on the backside of the fan and on the original packaging.
