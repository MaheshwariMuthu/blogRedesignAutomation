  If you’ve ever had to do the dishes by hand, you appreciate how much easier a dishwasher makes your life. And with new innovations to this not-so-new kitchen appliance, your after-dinner chores are about to become even less of a chore as home-appliance manufacturer Hisense rolls out its [Smart Built-In Dishwasher](https://www.ces.tech/innovation-awards/honorees/2024/honorees/s/smart-built-in-dishwasher-with-autodose-autodry.aspx), which has been honored with an Innovation Award in the Home Appliance category at CES 2024.

The annual CES convention in Las Vegas (formerly known as the Consumer Electronics Show) showcases the latest consumer technology before it makes its way into people’s hands and homes. One of the emerging trends from products that have earned a CES Innovation Award nod is that of high-tech solutions that solve nagging everyday problems. Falling into that make-life-easier category is the new Smart Built-In Dishwasher unveiled by Hisense.

Here's how it improves the dishwashing experience in a few different ways:

Autodose Technology
-------------------

Perhaps the most impressive aspect of the new dishwasher is that it comes with an autodose feature that allows users to load their dishes and simply select a cleaning program. From there, the dishwasher automatically dispenses the correct amount of detergent. The dishwasher's auto-dosing compartment can store up to a month's worth of detergent, which means that there's no need to fill it up each time with powder or pods for every load.

Autodry Door Pop-Out for Swift Drying
-------------------------------------

The innovation doesn't stop with the cleaning cycle. Once the dishwasher completes its job, the Autodry door pop-out function comes into play. This feature automatically opens the dishwasher door to expel steam efficiently, providing a quick and effective method for drying dishes. This not only enhances the overall efficiency of the dishwasher but also contributes to a faster turnaround time for clean, dry dishes.

Spacious and Flexible Design
----------------------------

Designed with user convenience in mind, the Hisense Smart Dishwasher boasts a big interior with flexible loading options, which can hold up to 15 place settings in a single run. This means users can fit a variety of dishes, plates, cups and utensils, optimizing the dishwasher's capacity for larger loads.

Whisper-Quiet Operation with Inverter Technology
------------------------------------------------

Even though it's something of a workhorse, Hisense's latest dishwasher is also exceptionally quiet. That's because it incorporates the company's proprietary inverter technology, which delivers a remarkably quiet operation at just 40 decibels, equivalent to the ambient noise level inside a library.

First of Its Kind
-----------------

According to Hisense, their Innovation-Award-winning dishwasher will be the only smart dishwasher with auto-dosing and auto-dry door pop-out features in the U.S. market.

“This award is just the start of what’s to come for Hisense home appliances,” said David Gold, President of Hisense Americas, in a [press release](https://www.prnewswire.com/il/news-releases/hisenses-smart-life-products-honored-with-ces-2024-innovation-awards-301990595.html). “Now, with an established team in the U.S. dedicated to quality product performance and developing new innovations, Hisense appliances will continue to improve and expand at breakneck speed. We look forward to introducing a wide range of new products over the next several years and growing Hisense’s position as a category leader not only in the U.S., but across the Americas.”

Indeed, in addition to the dishwasher honored with an Innovation Award, Hisense also has two other products that will be honored at the CES 2024. [Its 110 UX LCD screen](https://www.ces.tech/innovation-awards/honorees/2024/honorees/-/110-u9n.aspx) nabbed a prize in the Audio Video Components & Accessories category, and it was also honored in the In-Vehicle Entertainment category [with technology that can turn the inside of car windows into full laser-projected displays](https://www.ces.tech/innovation-awards/honorees/2024/honorees/v/vehicle-using-laser-projection-display.aspx).
