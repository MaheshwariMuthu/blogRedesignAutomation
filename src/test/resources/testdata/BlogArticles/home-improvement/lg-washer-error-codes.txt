  A malfunctioning washing machine can definitely make your life messy. The dirty laundry piles up, and you have nothing to wear. If the washer stopped working halfway through a cycle, you could even be left with a pile of wet clothes to deal with.

That’s why it’s important to get it working again as soon as possible. LG washing machine error codes can help you figure out what’s gone wrong and how to fix it.

What Is an Error Code?
----------------------

Error codes are important tools in troubleshooting that help repair technicians diagnose problems in computers and electronics. The machine determines where, and often why, an error has occurred, and the code communicates that to the user. This stops people from having to pull apart machines to determine what the issue is. Often, these codes allow you, as the user, to attempt to fix the problem rather than waiting for a repair tech to come out and service the machine.

Common LG Washing Machine Error Codes and What They Mean
--------------------------------------------------------

LG washing machine error codes are made up of a combination of letters and numbers. They should be listed in your user manual or can be found on the [LG support website](https://www.lg.com/us/support/help-library/lg-washer-error-code-list--20150140270078). Even within companies, error codes aren’t always universal. For example, dE errors can indicate a problem with the door or drawer, depending on the model. It’s important to check the code for your machine to make sure you have an accurate diagnosis of the problem.

Below are some of the common error codes for LG washing machines.

### IE

This code indicates a water inlet error. The correct water level has not been reached.

### UE, uE, UB

The load is unbalanced because it is too small, the clothes are gathered to one side or the appliance is tilted.

### 0E

Water is overflowing.

### FE

Water is overflowing. The drain pump will operate to drain water automatically.

### PE

The pressure sensor assembly is out of order.

### dE1, dE2

The door is not latched, or the door switch assembly is out of order.

### tE

The thermistor is out of order.

### LE

Connectors in the motor harness are disconnected.

### EE

### PF

There’s a power supply error in which power is supplied rapidly.

### Sud

The washing machine has detected too many suds.

### uS, V5, VS

The vibration sensor is out of order, or the vibration sensor communication is not working.

### Ed1

Do I Need to Call a Repair Tech, or Can I Fix These Errors on My Own?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Whether you need to call a repair tech will depend on the error. Some errors resolve on their own. For example, in most cases, a suds error will add a suds-reducing cycle to the wash. This adds around two hours to the wash cycle but doesn’t require any intervention from you.

Troubleshooting guides offer you steps to take to try to fix each LG washing machine error code. The guides also tell you when a service technician must be called. Repair techs are essential when computing or electrical components must be fixed or replaced.

If you plan to do any troubleshooting yourself, make sure you put safety first. A washing machine uses both water and electricity, which can be a dangerous combination. Unplug the machine when necessary, and if you’re in any doubt about your ability to do the repair, contact an LG service technician.<br><iframe title="YouTube video player" width="1072" height="603" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/E7N374KASqs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen title="Eco-friendly laundry hack!"></iframe>
