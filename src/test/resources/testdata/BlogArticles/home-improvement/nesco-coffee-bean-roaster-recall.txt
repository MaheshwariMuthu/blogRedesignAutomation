In the April 21 recall, the [Consumer Product Safety Commission](https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2021/Metal-Ware-Recalls-NESCO-Coffee-Bean-Roasters-Due-to-Fire-Hazard) reported that some NESCO coffee bean roasters could overheat, causing the plastic to melt or coffee beans to burn. Metal Ware has received 20 reports of incidents in which the roasters overheated, melted, smoked or caught fire; no injuries have been reported.

According to the Two Rivers, Wis.-based [distributor](https://www.nesco.com/recall-notice/), this recall affects Model CR-04-13 roasters that have date codes 2520 or 3220. You can find the model number and date code printed on the label on the bottom of the roaster; it's also printed on the bottom of the box the roaster came in.

The NESCO coffee bean roasters were manufactured in China and sold between August and December 2020. The roasters were sold nationwide at Blains Supply and Burman Coffee Traders stores, and [several online retailers](https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2021/Metal-Ware-Recalls-NESCO-Coffee-Bean-Roasters-Due-to-Fire-Hazard), including Kohls.com and Wayfair.com.

If you purchased a recalled coffee bean roaster, you should stop using it immediately. Contact the manufacturer for a full refund of $85 or a $100 refund in the form of store credit. Call Metal Ware toll-free at 888-993-9243 or email [beanroaster@nesco.com](mailto:beanroaster@nesco.com). Metal Ware will provide a prepaid mailer for return shipping.
