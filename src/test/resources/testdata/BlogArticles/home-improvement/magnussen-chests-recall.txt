  [Magnussen Home](https://www.magnussen.com/) is recalling about 13,200 Nova Series chests of drawers. If you purchased one of these chests between August 2009 and August 2015, it might fall under this recall. According to a Consumer Product Safety Commission [recall alert](https://cpsc.gov/Recalls/2021/Bel-Furniture-Recalls-Barrington-5-Drawer-Chests-Due-to-Tip-Over-and-Entrapment-Hazards-Sold-Exclusively-at-Bel-Furniture-Recall-Alert), the dressers may be unstable if they’re not anchored to a wall, posing a tipping hazard.

According to the [Oct. 27 recall](https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2022/Magnussen-Home-Recalls-Nova-Series-5-Drawer-Chests-Due-to-Tip-Over-and-Entrapment-Hazards), the chests don’t comply with the performance requirements as outlined in the voluntary industry standard [ASTM F2057-19](https://www.ahfa.us/regulatory-template/furniture-stability). If the chests tip over, children may become trapped, which could result in death or serious injury. The Riverside, Calif.-based company has received one report of a chest tipping over on a child, resulting in a minor bruise.

This recall involves specifically the Nova Series 5-Drawer Chest with model number B1428-10. Affected units have date codes between AG09 and AG15 (representing August 2009 through August 2015). You can find the product number and manufacturing date code on a label on the back of the unit.

The chests were manufactured in Vietnam and sold in furniture stores nationwide for about $600. Additionally, about 2,520 units were sold in Canada.

If you own a recalled chest, the CPSC recommends you stop using it immediately and contact Magnussen Home for a refund. The refund amount is pro-rated based on the age of the chest. Call 1-833-748-0210, email [recall@magnussen.com](mailto:recall@magnussen.com) or visit the recall page on the [company's website](https://www.magnussen.com/Recall) for more information.
