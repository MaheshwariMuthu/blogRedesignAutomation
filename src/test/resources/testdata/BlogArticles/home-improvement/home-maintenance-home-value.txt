But skipping those routine tasks, such as cleaning your gutters and touching up peeling paint, could affect your property's value.

How Does Proper Home Maintenance Affect Your Home's Value?
----------------------------------------------------------

Home maintenance tasks keep your house in good condition. They can prevent things such as mechanical failure, wear and tear, water damage or rotting materials. Homes that are in solid condition are more appealing to prospective buyers. They might be willing to pay more for a home that's solid because they don't have to invest a lot of money into restoring damaged areas.

Doing little repairs and upkeep tasks can also keep your curb appeal high, which adds to home value. A house that presents well might encourage more buyers to look at it.

Even if you don't plan on selling soon, keeping your home in good condition is important. Maintaining a high home value means it will be ready to go on the market down the road if you decide to sell. Ignoring home maintenance for years can cause expensive issues that you have to repair before you can sell your home. Completing those repairs cuts into your profits on the sale.

What Are the Most Important Regular Maintenance Tasks for Home Value?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

If you don't have time to tackle everything, focus on the maintenance and repairs that increase home value the most. These are things that keep your home in good condition and structurally sound. Some of those home maintenance tasks include the following.

### 1. HVAC Maintenance

Your HVAC system keeps your home comfortable and safe, so maintaining it is essential. Replacing a furnace and AC is also costly. Preventative maintenance, including changing the air filters and scheduling professional tune-ups each year, can keep the equipment running longer and more efficiently. That can save you money while you live there and give new buyers peace of mind.

### 2\. Roof Maintenance

Another potentially expensive area for repairs is your roof. With proper maintenance, you can improve the value of your home and prevent serious water damage. Keeping your roof strong and free of damage helps keep water out of your attic. To maintain your roof, clean your gutters frequently to help water flow away from the roofing. Visually inspecting the roof and having damage repaired quickly can also help.

### 3\. Plumbing Maintenance

Your plumbing could be another source of expensive water damage. Inspect exposed pipes regularly to look for signs of deterioration or leaking. Watch for signs of an issue, including poor water pressure, dripping sounds, increased moisture, higher water bills and smelly water. If you notice any of those issues, call a plumber to investigate.

### 4\. Repainting

Chipped, cracked paint makes your home look older and could make people think there are other issues. Repainting your home when it starts to peel or look grungy can keep your home value higher. Outdoors, a good pressure wash on your siding could remove enough grime to make it look newer.

### 5\. Landscape Cleanup

Your landscaping makes a big first impression, so take the time to keep it up. Removing weeds from garden beds and mowing regularly gives your home a polished look. You might need to trim overhanging branches on trees or shape your bushes occasionally. Replacing damaged borders and removing dead plants can also help.

### 6\. Appliance Care

Appliances are an important element in any home. Routine maintenance keeps them clean, working properly and energy efficient. Appliance-specific maintenance might vary. For a refrigerator, you need to clean the coils, level the unit, clean the gaskets and change the water filters. Dishwashers have filters that need to be cleaned, and the gaskets should be checked and cleaned regularly as well.

### 7\. Exterior Repairs

Sealing holes and gaps on the outside of your home can help you feel more comfortable inside. These issues often make your home less energy efficient, which can force your HVAC system to work harder. It can also leave your home drafty and uncomfortable.<br><iframe title="YouTube video player" width="1072" height="603" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pM2NlhbKBH0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen title="How to Drain A Water Heater | Hot Water Tank Tips"></iframe>
