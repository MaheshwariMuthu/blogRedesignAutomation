Before you attempt to fix them, you should check the warranty. It’s quite possible that you can send your blinds to the manufacturer if they’re still covered by the warranty. The company may send replacements, or they may repair them for you.

Despite being covered by warranty, it’s not always the easiest thing to get through to customer support to send them in. If you don’t want to deal with the hassle, the damage isn’t covered or the warranty has expired, you can repair a broken blinds string yourself. Here’s everything you need to know to get this fixed.

Steps to Fix Broken Blinds Strings
----------------------------------

Whether you own honeycomb blinds, Venetian blinds or wood blinds, if the blinds no longer go up or down, there’s a good chance that something is malfunctioning with the strings. A string have broken altogether.

Thankfully, you don’t need too many tools for this project. All that’s required are scissors, a screwdriver, tweezers and a replacement string.

### Step 1: Examine the Strings

You first want to determine the root cause of the issue. If you need to order replacement parts, make sure you understand what exactly is broken so you don’t end up wasting your money buying something you don’t need.

If you notice that the strings on the blinds are snarled or broken at any point, chances are this is the main issue. No matter how good of a condition your blinds might be in, they can’t operate with broken strings.

### Step 2: Remove the Blinds From the Window

Depending on the types of blinds you have, the steps for dismounting them might be slightly different. In general, you can start by opening the cover and pushing the clips so the blinds pop out. The edges holding them up will have an opening you can [push up to get them to come off](https://youtu.be/uMsDzQY0o_8?t=31). After you’ve removed them, place them down on a flat surface.

### Step 3: Remove the Broken String

With the blinds on the ground, it’s easier to remove the broken string. At the bottom of the blinds where the strings meet, there are small caps that cover the cords. You can use a flathead screwdriver to pop the cap open.

Once it’s open, start to pull the broken string out through the hole, which is also commonly referred to as the slat. At this point, you might also need to use scissors to cut the tangled string to make it easier to remove.

### Step 4: Add the New String to Blinds

With the old broken string now fully removed, you can add the new replacement string. Start by sliding in the string through the bottom slat where you removed the old string.

This next step might not be necessary, depending on the type of blinds you have: After you push the string through the bottom slat, add the string through the holes in all the blinds, weaving it over and under the ladder strings. Continue to do this until you reach the top.

Near the bottom, tie a knot so the string can’t slip out through the bottom slat. You should also replace the cap that you removed earlier with a new one.

### Step 5: Add the String to Headrail

After the string has been added to all the blinds, it’s time to attach it to the headrail. Use tweezers to hold the string cord since it can be pretty challenging to hold it with your hands as you try to move it through the headrail. Push the string through the headrail and into the pulley, so it acts as a pull cord. After it’s fed through the pulley, tie the string end to the other pull cord ends.

Once that’s done, you’re all finished. Make sure to do a quick pull test to check that everything is working correctly and the string was properly added.

### How to Prevent Blinds Strings From Damage

Unless you want to continuously fix or replace broken strings, you’ll want to prevent this from happening in the first place. The most common reason why blind strings get snarled or broken is due to pulling and tugging. If you have children, they’re the most likely culprits. Teach them to be gentle with the blinds or keep the blinds up when they’re around. Another step you can take is to get blinds that hide the strings. Blinds like cellular shades do a great job at keeping the strings hidden from sight.

Of course, another option is to simply use cordless blinds. Cordless blinds are increasing in popularity as they have no strings you need to maintain and still provide a stylish look. The lack of strings also makes them safer to have around small children and pets.
