According to the [Consumer Product Safety Commission](https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2021/Goal-Zero-Recalls-Power-Cables-Due-to-Fire-Hazard), the pins inside the power cords can become deformed and may overheat, posing a fire risk. The Bluffdale, Utah-based [manufacturer](https://www.goalzero.com/product-features/ec8-recall/) has received four reports of such incidents, in which the cables were connected to a vehicle battery. The cables overheated, melted or caught on fire, leading to property damage in some cases; no injuries had been reported.

Goal Zero has recalled two models: the 12-foot EC8 Extension cables and Male EC8 to Ring cables. The affected model numbers are 98201 and 98202, respectively. The 12-foot cable was sold individually and in the Car Charge Kit. The Male EC8 cable was also sold individually and with various Yeti Tanks.

The cables were manufactured in China and were sold at REI, Sportsman’s Warehouse and Bass Pro Shops. They were also available online from Amazon, Backcountry and Goal Zero’s website.

If you own one of these cables, the CPSC recommends you stop using it immediately and contact the manufacturer for a free replacement. Call Goal Zero at 888-794-6250, email [productreplacement@goalzero.com](mailto:productreplacement@goalzero.com) or fill out the product replacement form [here](https://www.goalzero.com/product-features/ec8-recall/).
