According to the Burnsville, Minn.-based [manufacturer](https://www.northerntool.com/shop/tools/help_product-recalls-item-799215), the affected Powerhorse 13000ES Portable Generators contain an incorrectly wired receptacle that may cause electrical shock if the unit is not appropriately grounded. This wiring issue affects the L5-30R 120V/30A receptacle, which is often used for RVs or at marinas.

The recall was announced Feb. 24. The affected generators bear the model number 799215.
