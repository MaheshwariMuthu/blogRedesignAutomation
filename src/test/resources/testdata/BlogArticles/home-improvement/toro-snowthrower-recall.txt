  If you purchased a Toro-brand snowthrower between November 2020 and January 2021, you’re going to want to pay attention.

[According to Toro](https://www.toro.com/en/product-safety-information/my21-power-max-826-snowthrower-recall), the auger can fail to disengage when the control lever is released, potentially resulting in serious injury. Affected by the voluntary recall — [announced Feb. 17](https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2021/Toro-Recalls-Power-Max-Snowthrowers-Due-to-Amputation-Hazard) by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission — are model-year 2021 Toro Power Max 826 OHAE Snowthrowers, Model Number 37802. The Juarez, Mexico-built snowthrowers sell for around $1,200 at The Home Depot, Ace Hardware and other authorized dealers.

Toro stated that it has received five reports of the issue, but was not aware of any related injuries.

“Consumers should immediately stop using the recalled Toro Power Max Snowthrower and contact a Toro authorized dealer for a free repair,” the manufacturer said in a statement.

If you think your Toro snowthrower might be subject to the recall, find the model number and serial number on the back of the device, then check your serial number against those [listed at the bottom of the page, here](https://www.toro.com/en/product-safety-information/my21-power-max-826-snowthrower-recall).
