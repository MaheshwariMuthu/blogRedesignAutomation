According to the Consumer Product Safety Commission’s July 29 [recall announcement](https://cpsc.gov/Recalls/2021/generac-recalls-portable-generators-due-to-finger-amputation-and-crushing-hazards), the unlocked handle on the generator can pinch the user’s fingers against the frame when the unit is moved. Generac has received eight reports of injuries — one involving a finger crushing and seven which resulted in finger amputations.

The affected Generac generators have unit type numbers XT8000E, XT8000EFI, GP6500, GP6500E, GP8000E and HomeLink 6500E. DR unit types include the PRO 6500M and PRO 6500E. To check whether your portable generator is included in this recall, find the model and serial numbers on the label and check them against [this list](https://cpsc.gov/Recalls/2021/generac-recalls-portable-generators-due-to-finger-amputation-and-crushing-hazards). You can also look up this information on [Generac’s website](http://www.generac.com/service-support/product-support-lookup).

The portable generators were made in the U.S. and China, and sold at major home improvement, hardware and big-box retailers — including Ace Hardware, The Home Depot, Costco, Amazon, Lowe’s and True Value — nationwide and online. Find the [full list of retailers](https://cpsc.gov/Recalls/2021/generac-recalls-portable-generators-due-to-finger-amputation-and-crushing-hazards). In addition, about 4,575 units were recalled in Canada.

If your generator is affected by this recall, the CPSC recommends you immediately stop using the product, unless the locking pin has been inserted to secure the handle in place. You can contact Generac for a repair kit. Call the Waukesha, Wis.-based [manufacturer](http://www.generac.com/) at 844-242-3493, or fill out the [online request form](https://www.generac.com/handleguard).
